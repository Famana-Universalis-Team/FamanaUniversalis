 van_technological_advantage_title:0 "Technological Advantage"
 van_technological_advantage_desc:0 "Vanoma and technology go hand in hand. Ever since the establishment of the University of Montava, knowledge has always been highly valued. If we make additional technological strides, we may be able to gain a significant advantage over our barbarian neighbors."
 van_colonize_borlebin_title:0 "Settle the Eastern Plains"
 van_colonize_borlebin_desc:0 "To our east is a lightly settled grassland area, populated by uncivilized tribes. Colonizing it ourselves would bring us closer to the Aresians, allowing us to trade with them, or maybe engage in some less peaceful endeavors."

 #Kinvireli Missions
 kin_theory_of_helvania_title:0 "Theory of Helvania"
 kin_theory_of_helvania_desc:0 "The Theory of Helvania was invented centuries ago in Ancient Vaximor.

It is vital that we preserve these values and do not succumb to autocracy like the rest of Jasua."
 kin_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"

 kin_the_lathvy_question_title:0 "The Lathvy Question"
 kin_the_lathvy_question_desc:0 "The question of the Lathvy faith has plagued Kinvirel for years. Many in the country choose follow this new religion, especially in the northern cities. While the faith is completely tolerated in Kinvirel and sometimes mixes with local pagan worship, we ought to make up our mind. Should we adopt this religion, or hold on to our old beliefs?"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_title:0 "The One True Faith"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_desc:0 "Our state has finally chosen to adopt a single religion. But the religious problems of Kinvirel are far from over, as many in the country are not fully commited to their faith. To secure religious unity in Kinvirel, we must practice it to its fullest extent."
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_title:0 "Jasuan Religious Unity"
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_desc:0 "Jasua has long been divided along religious lines. In the south, Oppians practiced their own faith. In the north, many converted to the pagan Bamali religion. In Kapolia, Lathvy reigned supreme. This religious division is no more! Our ruler has seen to it that every Jasuan worships the same gods."
 kin_end_the_dark_age_title:0 "End the Dark Age"
 kin_end_the_dark_age_desc:0 "For far too long, Jasua has been mired in poverty and division. Ever since the Oppio-Jasuan War, the cities and roads of Jasua, once the greatest in the world, have been neglected and are now in a truly deplorable state. The Dark Age of Jasua has gone on for long enough. We are now in a position to finally reunite Jasua under one state, bringing an end to the current state of affairs so that we may rebuild and reclaim our status as a Gomic great power."
 kin_expel_mahansha_title:0 "Expel Mahansha"
 kin_expel_mahansha_desc:0 "Mahansha is a pest for the entire Eastern Gomic. Their ships raid and pillage the coasts of Jasua and beyond indiscriminately. This cannot be allowed to continue, so Mahansha must be driven out of Jasua."
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_title:0 "Defeat Zoblotra"
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_desc:0 "Our conquest of Mahansha has shown that our army is capable of fighting back against the Oppians. With this in mind, it would seem foolish not to attack the weak Zoblotrans to our south."
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_title:0 "Gomic Coffee Monopoly"
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_desc:0 "Coffee has never been an important export of Kinvirel. Spices and paper have always overshadowed our small coffee plantations. But now that we have conquered parts of the Hoxoi Coast, it is becoming clear that we are in control of the entire Gomic's supply of these precious beans. Perhaps this should be taken advantage of."
 kin_pacify_bamal_title:0 "Pacify Bamal"
 kin_pacify_bamal_desc:0 "The Bamali people, once an ally of ours, have been integrated into our realm. We must secure our hold on the region before we expand further northward."
 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_title:0 "Reforging the Jasuan Empire"
 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_desc:0 "The time has come to restore the mighty Jasuan Empire. The new empire, having regained the former glory of the old, will soon come to overshadow its predecessor. As we expand along the shores of the Gomic, we will spread the noble ideals of Jasua. The new golden age of Jasua is upon us."
 kin_hinder_yabonia_title:0 "Hinder Yabonia"
 kin_hinder_yabonia_desc:0 "To our east lumbers the giant Kingdom of Yabonia. Stronger than our puny republic, yet severely overstretched, Yabonia may be difficult to defeat. But with a strong army and the help of allies, we may just be able to."
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_title:0 "Onward to Jimkalin"
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_desc:0 "Our victorious conquest of western Yabonia has greatly weakened our rival and brought us closer to their capital. With these new territories in hand, we have a real claim to the entirety of the Jasuan heartland."
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_title:0 "Neutralize Yabonia"
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_desc:0 "Yabonia will soon be all but destroyed. We have conquered most of their land, and what remains of their pathetic kingdom will soon be wiped out by our grand army. We are now the rulers of the Jasuan heartland, so it is time to take the rest of our rightful territory."
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_title:0 "Unification with Kapolia"
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_desc:0 "Kapolia. The final piece of Jasua, yet unclaimed by our rising republic. Whether through diplomacy or war, we will integrate it into our state."
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_title:0 "Pearl of Jasua"
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_desc:0 "Kinvirel, our capital and most important city, is the greatest city in Jasua and the historic capital. But if we expanded the city even more, Kinvirel could truly be a jewel of the eastern Gomic."
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_title:0 "Sponsor the Merchants"
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_desc:0 "Many of our merchants are struggling to compete with Maxan and Xalnish traders. To secure our hold on the eastern Gomic trade network, we should do everything we could to make their job as easy as possible."
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_title:0 "Eastern Gomic Trade"
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_desc:0 "As the major trading power in the eastern Gomic, we are making a lot of money. However, to truly dominate the trade routes, we need a large merchant fleet."
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_title:0 "Assert Control of Hartimatul"
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_desc:0 "Harmanul, our old trading colony, has always been very important. It is a vital outpost for our merchants, but one thing has always been preventing us from using it as a staging ground for invading the Maxan isles, that being the local Maxan population. To take full advantage of Hartimatul, we must expel the locals and re-settle it with Jasuans."

 fas_venture_westward_desc:0 "Our warriors yearn for glorious combat and precious loot. To find it, we must go west, and bring more than just warriors. We have to expand the Fashran Tonxara."
 fas_ensure_tonmo_unity_title:0 "Ensure Tonmo Unity"
 fas_ensure_tonmo_unity_desc:0 "It is vital that our religion stays united under one school of thought. Different branches splitting off from the central faith would undermine the ambitions of our state."
 fas_reform_the_faith_title:0 "Reform the Faith"
 fas_reform_the_faith_desc:0 "With the power of the Tonxara, we can change the Tonmo religion. While it is obviously the one true religion, how can we be sure we have interpreted it correctly? We should hire a highly enlightened intellectual to figure it out for us. A Tonmo reformation is in order if we want our faith to be more than mere pagan rituals."
 fas_a_final_push_title:0 "A Final Push"
 fas_a_final_push_desc:0 "It is official: the Jasuan cities are real. All that remains to do is expanding our borders to the nearby state of Biliku, connecting us to Jasua. This may take a concerted military effort, but it will be worth it."
 fas_destroy_biliku_title:0 "Destroy Biliku"
 fas_destroy_biliku_desc:0 "Biliku has been eviscerated by our forces! Cities burn, peasants flee, and the loot and glory are ours. The horde has arrived, and will show no mercy."
 fas_conquer_nozumol_title:0 "Conquer Nozumol"
 fas_conquer_nozumol_desc:0 "We have encountered the tribe of Nozumol to our immediate west. They are heathens, plain and simple, following the same faith as the cowardly Geopyopians. Conquering Nozumol will let us expand further westward, in search for more lucrative places to pillage."
 fas_rumors_of_the_west_title:0 "Rumors of the West"
 fas_rumors_of_the_west_desc:0 "Scouts tell of a vast civilization in the west, known primarily as "Jasua". They say it has cities of massive grandeur and wealth, ripe for looting and pillaging. Our warrior chiefs are practically salivating at the notion, so we ought to send a larger scouting party to investigate further."
 fas_the_vanoman_question_title:0 "The Vanoman Question"
 fas_the_vanoman_question_desc:0 "The Vanomans are a curious bunch. They have set up a colony on the coast of the grasslands, which is apparently some kind of trading post. The question on everyone's mind is, how do we deal with this?"
 fas_build_a_navy_title:0 "Build a Navy"
 fas_build_a_navy_desc:0 "With our newfound presence in the Aresian Gulf, and inability to find a northern route to connect the eastern and western coasts, it is imperative that we build a separate navy in the Gulf."
 fas_a_new_capital_title:0 "A New Capital"
 fas_a_new_capital_desc:0 "Our country is no longer a mere tribal confederation cursed with obscurity and poverty. We are now a great empire stretching from west to east over a great length of territory. We rule many different peoples in many different lands. Anmoea may not be the right choice for our capital anymore. Something more central could be better."
 fas_dimdivu_docks_title:0 "Dimdivu Docks"
 fas_dimdivu_docks_desc:0 "To claim naval hegemony over the Aresian Gulf, we need a proper home base for our fleet. Dimdivu will do nicely for this purpose."
 fas_pillage_kinvirel_title:0 "Pillage Kinvirel"
 fas_pillage_kinvirel_desc:0 "Kinvirel, the so-called pearl of Jasua, has been claimed for the Tonxara! Here, the greatest treasures of Jasua can be found. We have found records of Jasuan technology, which we will steal. We have also found many priceless Jasuan artifacts, which we will of course also pilfer from the city."
 fas_raid_jimkalin_title:0 "Raid Jimkalin"
 fas_raid_jimkalin_desc:0 "Yabonia has been a thorn in our side for years now. One of the strongest Jasuan states, it has been hard to defeat. But now that we have taken the capital city of Jimkalin, we can finally claim victory. We shall destroy this city, raze it to the ground until nothing remains but ash. Without this city, Yabonia will crumble."
 fas_defeat_yabonia_title:0 "Defeat Yabonia"
 fas_defeat_yabonia_desc:0 "Yabonia is collapsing before us, and we must take advantage. Sweeping up the remnants of the Yabonian state will allow us to also conquer the squabbling warlords of southern Jasua."
 fas_conquer_bamal_title:0 "Conquer Bamal"
 fas_conquer_bamal_desc:0 "Bamal is a rich and central strip of coastline in the southern Aresian Gulf. Taking this land will truly open the floodgates for the horde, allowing us to move into not just Jasua, but Aresia as well."
 fas_into_aresia_title:0 "Into Aresia"
 fas_into_aresia_desc:0 "The Aresians are clearly weak, and a prime target for subjugation to the Tonxara. They are easily defeated in battle, exhibiting poor morale and unwillingness to fight. The war for Aresia will not be a challenging one."
 fas_subjugate_nakoa_title:0 "Subjugate Nakoa"
 fas_subjugate_nakoa_desc:0 "Nakoa is apparently the greatest of the Aresian states. No matter, they are just as weak as the ones we have already fought, and will not be much of a problem for us."
 fas_montavas_treasure_title:0 "Montava's Treasure"
 fas_montavas_treasure_desc:0 "Montava, the legendary capital of Vanoma, is within our reach. Within this city, many technologies we desire can likely be found, such as the secret to how the vanomatis functions."
 fas_the_vanoman_heartland_title:0 "The Vanoman Heartland"
 fas_the_vanoman_heartland_desc:0 "Vanoma is a rich, advanced and innovative culture, and it would be a shame to not bring it into our sphere of influence. By alliance or conquest, we should try to take control of the kingdom."
 fas_develop_the_steppe_title:0 "Develop the Steppe"
 fas_develop_the_steppe_desc:0 "The steppes of Fashros have long been underdeveloped. For a proper, unified society to exist in these harsh grasslands, the territories must be developed. New roads, trading posts and cities will make this place both prosperous and easier to rule."
 fas_great_cities_of_the_east_title:0 "Great Cities of the East"
 fas_great_cities_of_the_east_desc:0 "The eastern portions of the empire constitute the homeland of the Ravsho people. Despite this, there are no great cities in these lands. The cities of Anmoea, Pizuk and Tyma should be among the world's greatest, yet they are not. We must rectify this."
 fas_the_nhoma_tonxara_title:0 "The Nhoman Tonxara"
 fas_the_nhoma_tonxara_desc:0 "We have developed the steppes of Nhoma extensively, building up its local economy and constructing glorious cities. This will allow a centralized state to exert its rule over the region, should the need arise."
 fas_invade_the_hoxoi_coast_title:0 "Invade the Hoxoi Coast"
 fas_invade_the_hoxoi_coast_desc:0 "As we finish our conquest of Jasua, sweeping up the last remnants of independent kingdoms, the question of what is next is one that needs an answer. The best route for further expansion seems to be the Hoxoi Coast, as it should be fairly easy to traverse and may lead to more great civilizations along the western sea."
 fas_plunder_xolnomarka_title:0 "Plunder Xolnomarka"
 fas_plunder_xolnomarka_desc:0 "Some call it Ga Xal, others call it Xolnomarka. It does not matter to us, and it shall be destroyed either way. A wealthy, prosperous and strong civilization exists here, but they are not united. They squabble and fight amongst each other, and this we shall use to our advantage. They, too, will bow to Gaara."
 fas_ga_tonmo_title:0 "Ga Tonmo"
 fas_ga_tonmo_desc:0 "The Xalians are divided when it comes to religion. Their faith seems to be split into 4, which makes them spiritually weaker. This will allow us to introduce the Tonmo faith easily. Their temples can be converted to Tonmo ones, and their clergymen can be replaced with Tonmo missionaries."
 fas_birth_of_the_tonmo_world_title:0 "Birth of the Tonmo World"
 fas_birth_of_the_tonmo_world_desc:0 "The Tonmo world, what was once but a dream, has come to fruition. Diverse, modernized and with a strong leader, our faith and civilization are due to prosper for centuries to come. As said leader, we may reap the rewards."
 fas_fashran_renaissance_title:0 "Fashran Renaissance"
 fas_fashran_renaissance_desc:0 "Ravsho thought once flourished around the campfires of tribal villages. Nowadays, we have been busy conquering and pillaging, leaving little room for thinking. But with our newly consolidated empire, it may be a prime occasion to sponsor Tonmo philosophers. It will be a golden era for Fashros, a renaissance of Ravsho philosophy and art."
 fas_tonmo_science_title:0 "Tonmo Science"
 fas_tonmo_science_desc:0 "Science, a foreign to concept to Ravsho scholars, has been picked up from conquered peoples and adopted into the realm of Ravsho philosophy. Our scholars have made great strides since, in fields such as astronomy and mathematics. No one understands the heavens and the inner workings of the universe as we do."
 fas_the_jafxoi_tonxara_title:0 "The Jafxoi Tonxara"
 fas_the_jafxoi_tonxara_desc:0 "Through conversion to the Tonmo faith, the Xalian elites have been primed to run a Tonxara of their own, should the need arise. After Fashros is gone, the region will remain a bastion of our religion."
 fas_the_three_crowns_title:0 "The Three Crowns"
 fas_the_three_crowns_desc:0 "Nhoma, Jafxoi and Kisholi have been prepared for eventual self-rule. As the days of the Fashran Tonxara appear to be numbered, we can be sure that this was the right choice. Whoever succeeds us will greatly benefit from our forward thinking."
 fas_secure_the_empire_title:0 "Secure the Empire"
 fas_secure_the_empire_desc:0 "While we are undoubtedly a great power, our situation is fragile. If we do not act quickly to show our dominance over our neighbors, including our brothers in faith, then our great nation could very well be lost. We must be ruthless, or [Root.GetName] will be assigned to the dustbin of history."
 fas_supremacy_of_the_clouds_title:0 "Supremacy of the Clouds"
 fas_supremacy_of_the_clouds_desc:0 "We have shown our military dominance, but we cannot lead the Tonmo world if we are not the spiritual leader as well. With a wealthy population and strong religious cohesion, we can show ourselves to be the true successor to Fashros."
 fas_crush_kapolia_title:0 "Crush Kapolia"
 fas_crush_kapolia_desc:0 "Kapolia is a great danger to our empire, as their faith is also spreading quickly in Jasua. We cannot tolerate this, so we must destroy the Kapolian state utterly. Getting rid of Kapolia will allow us to establish total religious control of Jasua."
 fas_seize_the_northern_shores_title:0 "Seize Emastaly"
 fas_seize_the_northern_shores_desc:0 "The Emastalians are Lathvy, like the Kapolians. This is an intolerable religion, as it presents a real alternative to the worship of Gaara. Just as Kapolia had to be destroyed, so do the states of Emastaly."
 fas_leaving_the_steppe_title:0 "Leaving the Steppe"
 fas_leaving_the_steppe_desc:0 "While we can trace our heritage to the barbaric Fashran Tonxara, we are a civilized people now. [Root.GetName] is a true settled state with a strong leader and professional army. We have left the life of the steppe nomad behind to flourish as a strong and wealthy empire."
 fas_conversion_of_the_jasuans_title:0 "Conversion of the Jasuans"
 fas_conversion_of_the_jasuans_desc:0 "Jasua is a great void of religion, as the rapid decline in traditional beliefs allows foreign faiths to take hold. The true faith of Tonmo will be this faith, if it can take root in the hearts of the Jasuan people."
 fas_the_kisholi_tonxara_title:0 "The Kisholi Tonxara"
 fas_the_kisholi_tonxara_desc:0 "The conversion of the Jasuans to the Tonmo faith has changed their culture in turn; they are now the Kisholi. This new identity means any new Tonmo state formed in this region will be the strongest of them all."

 kap_the_frontier_desc:0 "Yabonia. One of our foremost rivals, and a prime candidate for the reunification of Jasua.

 kap_kinvirel_1_title:0 "Take Ebinor"
 kap_kinvirel_1_desc:0 "Kinvirel is a city of great historic, cultural and economic significance. If we want to be the one to reunify Jasua, we must secure our control of Kinvirel.

 kap_kinvirel_2_title:0 "Claim Kinvirel"

 #Pextoglazian Missions
 pex_obtain_aras_approval_title:0 "Obtain Ara's Blessing"
 pex_obtain_aras_approval_desc:0 "The state of Pextoglazia is based wholly on the Lathvy religion. Without Ara's favor, we would have nothing! As it stands, the clergy are not happy with the situation, from which we can infer that Ara is also displeased. To restore the holiness of Pextoglazia, we must take action to ensure that we are following Ara's will."
 pex_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"
 pex_stabilize_the_realm_desc:0 "Despite the unifying faith, Pextoglazia is fundamentally a nation of many peoples. Pextans, Glazians, Walarans and Nevians all inhabit the same kingdom, and in recent years, ethnic tensions have threatened to fracture our increasingly volatile nation. To prevent the dissolution of Pextoglazia, we must crack down on all would-be rebellions. We have no choice but to ensure stability, lest we slide into anarchy and civil war."
 pex_defend_pextoglazia_title:0 "Defend Pextoglazia"
 pex_defend_pextoglazia_desc:0 "Our northern neighbors, the Ordicans, are eyeing our declining dominion with malicious intent. Ordica was once an ally of ours, but it is clear that this is no longer the case. To protect our borderlands, we must expand the army and build new fortifications."
 pex_reorganize_the_army_title:0 "Centralize the Nation"
 pex_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "Pextoglazia is a mess of royally appointed bishops, governors of questionable loyalty, and local clergymen and nobles with their own agendas. To have any chance of repelling an invading force, we have no choice but to rid ourselves of this decentralized system at any cost. The king must be granted more power over the nation so that its full might may be wielded against its enemies."
 pex_subdue_the_clergy_title:0 "Subdue the Clergy"
 pex_subdue_the_clergy_desc:0 "The Lathvy priests, bishops and scholars that make up the Pextoglazian clergy hold vast power over our country. The Religious Leader, who often gets to choose the next king, has a major say in what decisions are made. Ideally, the power of the clergy should be limited, as it is actively disrupting the ability of the government to react to the problems it faces. With bribes, land seizures and revokations of rights, it may be possible to lessen their power, but it will be costly."
 pex_ensure_diocese_loyalty_title:0 "Ensure Diocese Loyalty"
 pex_ensure_diocese_loyalty_desc:0 "Eastern Pextoglazia is ruled by a collection of state-appointed bishops who, while technically subsurvient to their king, are functionally independent. They serve as arms of the clergy, and their influence runs deep. We must ensure that they are loyal to the king, and the king only, or we risk having our own subjects turned against us by foreign powers."
 pex_prevent_collapse_title:0 "Prevent Collapse"
 pex_prevent_collapse_desc:0 "Having taken several harsh, time-consuming and expensive measures to reform, centralize and mobilize the country, it is now clear that Pextoglazia will survive. The collapse, foreseen by so many, will not come to pass. Pextoglazia will live on, stronger than ever, as the spiritual leader of the Lathvy world. The once divided groups of the country now stand as one, despite their many differences."
 pex_sway_the_inner_circle_title:0 "Sway the Inner Circle"
 pex_sway_the_inner_circle_desc:0 "While Pextoglazia is safe for the moment, it will not last forever. The bishops of eastern Pextoglazia are still de facto independent fiefdoms, so we should not give their bishops any opportunities to doubt the legitimacy of the state. Additionally, it is not only the dioceses that have questionable loyalties, but also the local rulers of New Pexamol. The island has been a hotbed of political dissent for a long time, and has even developed its own local culture. We must crush the local institutions and wipe away any semblance of independence from Pomlen."
 pex_integrate_the_walarans_title:0 "Institute Direct Rule"
 pex_integrate_the_walarans_desc:0 "The bishops of Lomea, Hilemo and Tegaria have bent the knee, but the easternmost dioceses remain free from government oversight. To bring these wayward provinces into the fold, we must first dissolve the dioceses of central Pextoglazia. Only then can we force the outer dioceses to relinquish their power. As our generals consider offensives into Ordica and Laglon, we will need the territory of the dioceses as staging grounds."
 pex_the_northern_menace_title:0 "The Northern Menace"
 pex_the_northern_menace_desc:0 "The Ordic dragon is waking up. The Ordicans are considering an invasion of our lands, and we are aware of this. To eliminate this grave threat to our own existance, we have no choice but to go on the offensive. Creating a buffer between the Pextoglazian and Ordican heartlands is the only way for us to truly be safe."
 pex_defeat_ordica_title:0 "Defeat Ordica"
 pex_defeat_ordica_desc:0 "Ordica has been pushed back by our righteous invasion, yet they remain a powerful foe. Southern Ordica still threatens the safety of the Slapni Sea coastline, so we ought to seize it too. With the southern half of Ordica in our hands, they will cease to be a threat in the foreseeable future."
 pex_deal_with_laglon_title:0 "Deal With Laglon"
 pex_deal_with_laglon_desc:0 "Laglon, the former Oppian colony that straddles the Estali coastline to our southwest, is a very interesting strip of territory. With it, we will be able to encroach on mainland Oppia, enabling us to make better trade deals and perhaps even establish a colony. To take control of Laglon, we have to first rip out its most important region, Druviked and its surrounding towns."
 pex_holy_restema_title:0 "Holy Restema"
 pex_holy_restema_desc:0 "Laglon is ours! These lands, formerly pagan, but now Lathvy, will be handed over to a loyal Feniki government who will enforce our will on the locals.With the help of Holy Restema, we will be able to influence Oppia greatly."
 pex_revenge_on_oppia_title:0 "Revenge on Oppia"
 pex_revenge_on_oppia_desc:0 "The Oppians are nothing if not backstabbing snakes. We could never trust them in the past, so now that we are in a strong position and they are not, it stands to reason that we should put an end to Oppia once and for all. They have wronged us time and again, without a care. Once, they stood together, but now they are fractured, and as much as this suits us, it could change. To prevent anything like the Burning of Moxon from happening again, it is our moral imperative to act. Ara calls for Oppia to be destroyed!"
 pex_into_emastalia_title:0 "Into Emastalia"
 pex_into_emastalia_desc:0 "The Emastalian coastline is inhabited by the descendants of Maxan settlers. By seizing the nearby trading city of Riximi, we will be able to launch further invasions, pushing east along the coast."
 pex_the_holy_coast_title:0 "The Holy Coast"
 pex_the_holy_coast_desc:0 "We have successfully taken control of Emastalia, integrating our brothers in faith into our great Lathvy regime. This wealthy and highly strategic shoreline will grant us control of the northern Gomic, allowing further invasions into both the great city of Bohora and our old homeland of Pextum."
 pex_invade_western_ordica_title:0 "Invade West Ordica"
 pex_invade_western_ordica_desc:0 "With control over mainland Ordica, this grants us the opportunity to advance deeper into western Estal. West Ordica is a relatively wealthy region populated mostly by Lathvyites. It is only appropriate that we should assert our control there."
 pex_reclaim_the_homeland_title:0 "Reclaim the Homeland"
 pex_reclaim_the_homeland_desc:0 "Pextum is once again ours! The Xalian invaders have been driven out of our ancient home, and it is now in the hands of its rightful rulers. The integration of this territory has facilitated a reconnection with our cousins across the sea, the descendants of those who could not flee the Morian invasions. Although they are now assimilated into Xalnish culture, we will learn to understand each other soon enough."
 pex_defy_syadon_title:0 "Defy Syadon"
 pex_defy_syadon_desc:0 "Syadon Noy and his Nafan armies have risen from what was once the lowly kingdom of Stroktur. He seeks to spread his heretical views and found an empire based on the ideals of the Eclipse movements. Clearly, he must be stopped, and we are the ones who will do have to do it. By conquering Bohora itself, we will put an end to the madness."
 pex_conquer_kapolia_title:0 "Conquer Kapolia"
 pex_conquer_kapolia_desc:0 "The conquest of Bohora has yielded great benefits. The degree of control we now have over the northern Gomic is almost absolute. Yet, there is another interesting prospect nearby. Conquering the Lathvy Jasuans of Kapolia would completely secure our dominance over the Gomic Sea, and firmly anchor us in Jasua."
 pex_champion_of_ara_title:0 "Champion of Ara"
 pex_champion_of_ara_desc:0 "We have bested our rivals to the north, and defeated Syadon in battle. We have combatted all forms of heresy and will continue to do so. We are truly the greatest champions of Ara!"
 pex_the_great_crusade_title:0 "The Great Crusade"
 pex_the_great_crusade_desc:0 "Having defeated the Oppians and secured our position as the one true leader of the Lathvy faith, it is about time we did something about the heathen barbarians in our backyard. Following decidedly non-Lathvy religions, these uncivilized peoples ought to be shown the fires of Ara. It is up to them if it will be by will or by force."
 pex_the_lathvy_empire_title:0 "The Lathvy Empire"
 pex_the_lathvy_empire_desc:0 "We have united most of the Lathvy world under one flag. As both the spiritual leader and ruler of most Lathvyites, we practically control the entire religion. Thus, we might as well make it official. Declaring ourselves as the Lathvy Empire would give us enormous soft power over Estal and beyond. No one could dispute our status as the great empire we really are."
 pex_establish_the_maxan_diocese_title:0 "Establish the Maxan Diocese"
 pex_establish_the_maxan_diocese_desc:0 "Bohora is ours! As we now control all of Moxon's colonies, there are those in our court who suggest we should take it a step further, and launch an invasion of Moxon itself. With Moxon in our hands, we could enforce our beliefs on those who still follow the despicable and heretical Maxan School of Thought."

 xalian_find_converts_title:0 "Recruit the Converts"
 xalian_find_converts_desc:0 "Although they are heretics who tried to destroy our region, the Ravshans are no doubt masters of Cavalry combat. As we slowly reclaim some lands where their descandants roam, we should give military jobs to the Ravshan bands who are willing to convert to our faith."
 xalian_expel_tonmo_title:0 "Expel the Tonmo"
 xalian_expel_tonmo_desc:0 "The Tonmo religion is completely heretical and not native to our land at all. It does not fit in, and has so far only caused tragedy. It should be wiped from our region as soon as possible."




 #Delkian Missions
 del_expand_the_cites_title:0 "Rebuild Cites"
 del_expand_the_cites_desc:0 "The cities of Delkia were utterly trashed by the Yomtanian armies during the Maxan War. Tragically, even our own capital is in ruins. It is time to begin the rebuilding process, so that our cites will again be the greatest of Ga Xal."
 del_pearl_of_delkia_title:0 "The Holy Capital"
 del_pearl_of_delkia_desc:0 "Ximal was once a mighty city. In the old days, it was a city larger than any other in Ga Xal besides Xon. Now, however, it is but a shadow of its former self, with most of the city having been destroyed. For the glory of Delk, we must rebuild Ximal and let it shine once more!"
 del_propestiy_for_all_title:0 "Prosperity for All"
 del_propestiy_for_all_desc:0 "Many of our people live in miserable shacks near the major cites, missing out on the prosperity enjoyed in the urban centers. All of Delk's subjects must be protected, as they are all children of the earth."
 del_modernize_army_title:0 "Modernize the Army"
 del_modernize_army_desc:0 "Delkia was once, a very long time ago, a strong military power. Today, it is not so. To compete with our rival Xalian powers, we must reform and modernize the army, as well as bring in new talent."
 del_turn_the_tables_title:0 "Turn the Tables"
 del_turn_the_tables_desc:0 "For decades, the Delkian people languished under Oppian rule. It is only appropriate that we take our revenge on the Oppians of Ropinver."
 del_ropinver_conquest_title:0 "Conquer Roklot"
 del_ropinver_conquest_desc:0 "We have a foothold on the Hoxoi Coast, but that is not enough for us to be safe. We must push further eastward to contain the Oppian menace."
 del_makyan_frontier_title:0 "Opmaki Frontier"
 del_makyan_frontier_desc:0 "The Opmaki are a strange people. They are farmers, artisans and warriors, like the three civilizations that mixed to create them. However, they are also first and foremost weak. There is no unified resistance in the region, which will let us conquer it easily. Additionally, an increased presence there may allow us to exert more influence over Zeaf."
 del_deal_with_gadea_title:0 "Deal With Gadea"
 del_deal_with_gadea_desc:0 "Gadea is the home of the heretical Gadan religion. They don't just rejekt Delk, but the three other Xalian gods as well. This we cannot tolerate!"
 del_ruins_of_jagama_title:0 "Seize Jagama"
 del_ruins_of_jagama_desc:0 "Jagama is one of the arteries of the Gomic trade network. While little actual trade gets done there, almost all merchants travelling from Oppia to Ga Xal use the roads in the area. Claiming this strategic strip of land for ourselves would be quite useful. The port of Bava could also be restored, granting us the possibility of projecting power in the Western Gomic."
 del_ideal_borders_title:0 "A Delkian Empire"
 del_ideal_borders_desc:0 "Delkia, long irrelevant and obscure, has risen once again! We have built an empire out of practically nothing, and are now an important player that cannot be ignored."
 del_protect_the_border_title:0 "Northern Raid"
 del_protect_the_border_desc:0 "Sixan is perhaps our greatest rival. To weaken them, we must launch raids against the towns near their capital, or if we are really daring, the capital itself."
 del_sixan_conquest_title:0 "March on Sixan"
 del_sixan_conquest_desc:0 "We will capture Sixan! Taking this city will give us a way to take the rest of Ga Xal, perhaps to unite the entire region."

 naf_dominate_the_gomic_desc:0 "We are in the prime position to dominate the trade routes of the Gomic. With our core territories right between the trade hubs of Emastalia and western Jasua, we could relatively easy take control of both regions, and thus become an economic superpower."
 naf_utilize_jzoet_desc:0 "The Jzoet tribe, our unlikely Yomtanian friends, have been very helpful so far. They have done many minor errands for us, and acted as the Emperor's personal bodyguards. Now, though, our generals are considering integrating them into the conventional army. They would provide tactical advice, logistical support and act as occupational forces behind the battle lines. After all, what would our neighbors think of us using Yomtanian soldiers? We wouldn't want another Maxan War with us at the receiving end."
 naf_founding_of_syadona_desc:0 "Our new state needs a grand capital, and Bohora won't do. While it is a very important city, Emperor Syadon wants an even grander city to be built in his honor. The prime candidate for this is Tyarda, one of the richest cities in all of Emastalia, sitting at the mouth of the mighty Emila river. With our seat of power in Tyarda, we will be unstoppable!"
 naf_emastalian_golden_age_desc:0 "With our growing control over the Emastalian cities, we have been able to more closely integrate the markets of Emastalia and Stroktur. Consequently, the region is now experiencing a true golden age of commerce and growth!"
 naf_build_a_grand_navy_desc:0 "The civilizations of the Gomic are all heavily influenced by the sea, and we are no different. If we wish to rule on land, we can't be afraid to get our feet wet. With a grand Nafan armada, we will conquer land and sea alike!"
 naf_the_staple_port_desc:0 "To increase our control over the Gomic trade routes, we must build robust trade hubs around the Gomic. Our merchant fleets need ports of call to rely on."
 naf_rival_the_ordics_desc:0 "With our conquest of Emastalia, and subsequent incursion into tribal Maldik lands, we have come into conflict with a new enemy: [OrdicaOrOrdisa]. This is no puny city state, but a massive empire! We must be careful when dealing with them, as there is a real risk that they could defeat us in battle."
 naf_destroy_the_ordican_empire_desc:0 "The [OrdicaOrOrdisa]ns thought themselves invincible, but we have proven them wrong. With a brutal occupation, we shall break the very fabric of their state apart until there is nothing left but a collection of squabbling warlords."
 naf_sweep_up_pextoglazia_desc:0 "Our rapid advance into western Estal has seen the destruction of two major powers in the region, the [OrdicaOrOrdisa]ns and the Feniki. Their absence has left the Pextoglazian region open for conquest."
 naf_burn_the_temple_desc:0 "Pomlen. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. It is the home of the High Priest and his temple, who command the beleivers of the heretical Pextoglazian school of thought. We must make sure no one falls for their lies, by burning their precious temple to the ground."
 naf_persuade_remaining_heretics_desc:0 "By crushing any and all heretics who wish to challenge our true interpretation of Lathvy, we will show all other Lathvyites that we are right. The vile Pextoglazians have been vanquished, and soon, there will be no one left to spread heretical falsehoods!"
 naf_link_gomic_infrastructure_desc:0 "By connecting the web of trade routes that fill the Gomic Sea into one, big trade network, we will enrich not just ourselves, but all of our subjects!"
 naf_influence_emastalia_desc:0 "Emastalia is a region with a delicate balance of power. We do not want to get involved, lest we get dragged into costly wars against the Emastalian city states. Instead, we should take a softer approach. By diplomatically tying the west Emastalian dukes to our country, we can slowly integrate them into Nafa."
 naf_the_summer_coast_desc:0 "Enough diplomacy! Any stragglers who still refuse to accept our rule will simply be forced to. However, we ought to take mercy on those who willfully choose to join us."
 naf_unite_emastalia_desc:0 "As we finish up the conquest of Emastalia, the question arises of where we should go next. Beyond Emastalia is a region populated by wild tribes, and beyond that lie Pextoglazia and Ordica. Perhaps we should learn from the Emastalians and establish settler colonies in the wilderness, to further our control of the region."
 naf_convert_ga_xal_desc:0 "While there are already many Lathvyites in Ga Xal since, and have been for a long time, most of the region is still filled with heathens. Obviously, this is not acceptable. We will convert Ga Xal to the true faith."
 naf_defeat_restema_desc:0 "Restema has been a problem for us for decades. For as long as we have had a navy, theirs has been far superior. Now, though, that is starting to change. With our new territories in Oppia, we may be able to fight on equal footing with the Restemans."
 naf_seize_miris_desc:0 "The Mirisans are a poor and backwards people. Normally, there wouldn't be much of a reason to bother conquering them, but we have recently discovered clues regarding the whereabouts of Hasia. The Feniki people seem to at least know a general direction, and that is along the Mirisan coast."
 naf_conquest_of_hasia_desc:0 "Finally, we are here! At last, we will be able to destroy the vile Yomtanian stronghold of Has, eliminating one of the foremost agents of Loys. Ara will surely be pleased with this development."
 naf_new_syadona_desc:0 "Apparently, a faction of the Rin Order has requested to set up shop in the city of Ragord. They wish to rename the city to New Syadona, and establish a sort of 'capital of the west'. From there, Nafa will be able to exert much more influence on western Estal, or so they say."
 naf_propagate_the_edolyssa_desc:0 "The Edolyssa has led to a massively improved standard of living for our subjects. We must spread it across our entire empire, teaching hygiene and building hospitals in major cities."
 naf_build_the_imperial_routes_desc:0 "The Gomic may be wealthy, but much of the flow of trade is slipping through our fingers, as it flows elsewhere, carrying vast amounts of wealth with it. To better organize the Gomic's maritime trade, imperial routes protected by our army and navy must be established."
 naf_landfall_in_elwait_desc:0 "The Xalians are weak and divided, and a prime candidate for invasion. First, though, we must cross the sea and establish a beachhead from which we can expand further south."
 naf_prepare_an_invasion_force_desc:0 "While we are clearly superior to the Xalians, we may have been underestimating them. They are, after all, a very wealthy and cunning people. Invading Ga Xal will require a signficant force to be deployed there."
 naf_defeat_xolnomarka_desc:0 "We have met the Xalians on the battlefield, and we have humiliated them! The Nafan legions were able to force theirs on the run, seizing the entire northern tip of the peninsula in the process."
 naf_xalian_integration_desc:0 "If we want to continue our southward advance, we must first integrate the lands we have seized into our empire. Not only will it make the process much smoother, but we could also send Xalian bureaucrats, who are said to be the best in the business, to elsewhere in Nafa's vast holdings."
 naf_dominate_jafxoi_desc:0 "With sheer military force, we will show the states of Ga Xal who is really in charge. Especially if we are able to defeat the Jafxoi Tonxara, which historically made major incursions into the peninsula, can we show that joining Nafa is the only real alternative."
 naf_intervene_in_oppia_desc:0 "Ga Xal is ours! Now, the path to Oppia lays open. As a wealthy, but divided peopel, the Oppians will be laughably easy for our legions to conquer. We shall lay waste to their armies, and with any luck we'll be in Quanex in just a few years."
 naf_lessons_from_old_empires_desc:0 "Oppia, the empire that once dominated the Gomic, and indeed ruled over Stroktur itself, is long gone by now. However, its institutions remain on a local level in Oppia. We should learn from their mistakes, and copy what they did right, since we are the new Gomic hegemon. In a way, we are their successor, so we should do what we can to avoid the same fate as theirs."
 naf_establish_the_rini_order_desc:0 "The Nafan legionaries have shown themselves to be a highly effective fighting force, defeating enemies with significantly higher numbers. Now, a group of radical Lathvy priests have founded a new military-religious order, the Rin Order. 'Rin' is a word that refers to the concept of dying a holy death in the name of Ara's glory."
 naf_technological_advantage_desc:0 "The scholars of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are the greatest in all the world! With the wealth of the empire, we are achieving levels of technological advancement previously unheard of!"
 naf_hold_fashros_at_bay_desc:0 "The Fashran hordes have descended on Jasua, and devoured nearly the entire region! We are the only thing that stands between it and the rest of Estal, so we must make haste to construct fortifications along the border."
 naf_partition_moxon_desc:0 "The Maxans are a mere shadow of the vast empire they once controlled. If we can land on the northern parts of the archipelago, we will be able to easily defeat them on sea as well as land."
 naf_a_compromise_in_thought_desc:0 "With our conquest of Moxon, we now have control of the home of the Maxan school of thought. Although they are technically a heretical school, they share much in common with ours, so we may be able to come to a mutual understanding and merge our schools of thought into one."
 naf_aresian_incursion_desc:0 "Kisholi is no more! Now, we set our sights on newly liberated Aresia. If we conquer the Aresian slopes and valleys, we can project power into all of eastern Estal, and even as far as Vanoma."
 naf_dominate_eastern_estal_desc:0 "With Vanoma and Aresia both subjugated, the natural next step would be to conquer the tribes of the Dorshelan forest, starting with the banks of the Emila."
 naf_fortify_gatria_desc:0 "The Ravsho barbarians have been expelled from Jasua, but we aren't safe just yet. To protect against any possible future invasion from the east, we must build a network of walls and forts along the frontier in Gatria."
 naf_claim_western_oppia_desc:0 "With the help of local Oppian Darli, the entire region has been placed firmly under Nafa's dominion. To make sure our new subjects don't get any funny ideas, Oppia must stay occupied for a few decades going forward."
 naf_undermine_the_tonxara_desc:0 "The vicious foreign empire that seeks to destroy our government and way of life has reached our very doorstep. But this is our home, and we know it better than they do. By infiltrating the ranks of the Tonxara and exploiting their weaknesses, we shall liberate all of Jasua from their heathen ways."
 naf_a_claim_to_jasua_desc:0 "We have successfully managed to fight back against the Ravsho hordes, but the people of Jasua are still, remarkably, not on our side. For us to have a real claim to rule over them, we must show that we really can defeat the Tonxara, and that we are the more desirable overlord."
 naf_destroy_kisholi_desc:0 "The Kisholi Tonxara has been soundly defeated. Nafa now rules Jasua undisputed, and the region shall never fall under Tonmo rule again!"
 naf_consolidate_jasua_desc:0 "Shockingly, many in Jasua are still opposed to living under our benevolent empire, so we have no choice but to crack down on unrest. First, a buffer must be established to protect the Jasuan heartland. Then, every dissident must be uncovered and disciplined to ensure our control will stand the test of time."
 naf_tolerate_the_kisholi_desc:0 "Tragically, before they were forced to retreat to the steppes, the Fashrans managed to spread their heathen faith to almost all of Jasua. The Jasuans, who, really, are now the Kisholi, are a Tonmo people. It would be all too difficult to convert all of them to the true Lathvy faith, so instead we might want to consider a different option. Tolerating their religion, and even integrating them into our armies, may be the best course of action."
 naf_gather_the_greatest_thinkers_desc:0 "While we are mostly sure of our faith, and have codified the Nafan school of thought accordingly, one mystery remains. The Eclipse: what did it all mean? We should find out."
 naf_ponder_the_eclipse_desc:0 "If we want to find out the real truth, we must look to the skies. Mainstream Lathvy doctrine holds that Ara's appearances on Famana manifest themself as great celestial phenomena, so that is where we should look. To get the whole picture, we should recruit scholars from the great scientific cultures of the world: the Vaximorians, the Vanomans, the Pawani and, of course, the Pextoglazian scholars of Pomlen."
 naf_the_truth_of_the_eclipse_desc:0 "Now we know the truth. We must spread the answer far and wide to everyone who will listen. We will not rest until every human being knows the Truth of the Eclipse!"
 naf_the_war_of_titans_desc:0 "§RThis branch of the mission tree is currently not available. It will be added in the coming Dorromas Update.§!"

 stroktur_adopt_emastalian_culture_desc:0 "There were some within our ranks who beleived we have some sort of ancestral connection to our Maxan forefathers. Clearly, that is a nonsensical viewpoint.

 klg_seize_trade_routes_desc:0 "With the Bohorans gone, there is now a mercantile power vacuum in the Eastern Gomic. Their old trade routes now sit unused, just waiting for us to take over where they left off."
 klg_the_jasuan_coast_title:0 "The Jasuan Coast"
 klg_the_jasuan_coast_desc:0 "Controlling the maritime trade routes of Jasua has made us very wealthy. This begs the question of why we should not seize its land routes as well."
 klg_secure_the_coast_title:0 "Secure the Coast"
 klg_secure_the_coast_desc:0 "The Maxan invaders arrived by sea, making landfall on the Gomic coastline. To protect our nation, and ensure this never happens again, we must ensure total control of the coast."

 klg_expel_the_bohorans_desc:0 "The Bohorans cannot be trusted. No matter how much they claim to be integrated into [Root.GetAdjective] society, we know this to be a ruse. We have no choice but to expel every single one of them from the country."
 klg_avenge_our_ancestors_title:0 "Avenge Our Ancestors"

 klg_a_new_homeland_title:0 "A New Homeland"
 klg_a_new_homeland_desc:0 "Having established ourselves in Moxon, it is only appropriate that we resettle the islands with Kachiks. They stole the land from us, and we will have it back."
 klg_great_kalarga_title:0 "Great Kalarga"
 klg_great_kalarga_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has reached heights of power and opulence never witnessed before by any Kachik. We have conquered the Gomic Sea and the forests of Estal, and we have taken revenge on those who wronged us in the past. [Root.GetName] is greater than it has ever been, and it will only grow stronger with time."
 klg_recruit_new_leaders_title:0 "Recruit New Leaders"
 klg_recruit_new_leaders_desc:0 "Our army now has a modernized structure and advanced weaponry, but we still lack a proper officer corps. No army can be truly great without the right leadership, and we must remedy this as soon as possible."
 klg_resettle_the_towns_title:0 "Resettle the Towns"
 klg_resettle_the_towns_desc:0 "The departure of the Bohorans has left many towns depopulated, ready for Kachik resettlement. While we are at it, we ought to build new and improved infrastructure in former Bohoran territories to expand our economy."
 klg_adopt_maxan_techniques_title:0 "Adopt Maxan Techniques"

 #Antiash Missions
 antiash_homeland_title:0 "Homeland of the Antiash"
 antiash_homeland_desc:0 "At the beginning of our westward expansion, we have to pass through the native place that we were forced to leave. These are just barren sands, not much more valuable than the rest of the desert, but we may find something of value left behind in the rush. "
 antiash_tokum_title:0 "Colonise Tokum"
 antiash_tokum_desc:0 "Establishing a few settlements on the banks of the southern Makyna before the Makyans take it over will provide us with a good base for attacks on their nations."
 antiash_kars_title:0 "Seize Kars"
 antiash_kars_desc:0 "The Karsians seem to have recovered from the time our raid destroyed their state, although they are now more Makyan than Karsian. Either way, their city will be first on the long list of our conquests in this region."
 antiash_delta_title:0 "Subjugate the Makyna Delta"
 antiash_delta_desc:0 "After marching into Okus the logical next step is the delta with its fertile land and ruins of a former empire. We will accomplish what we failed to do in 185 and the rulers in Makykay will learn that they really are a minor country that falls into the hands of others!"
 antiash_opmaki_title:0 "Attack the Opmaki"
 antiash_opmaki_desc:0 "Occupation of the petty kingdoms of the Opmaki will complete our conquest of Maky allowing us to link up with the invasion force in Ximal and launch a direct attack on Morsum."
 antiash_jexus_title:0 "Central Xalian Campaign"
 antiash_jexus_desc:0 "'Whoever controls central Ga Xal, controlls the Gomic' - atleast that's what one of our chieftains said. The Moshirian maybe aren't the best generals, but they will make good soldiers to fuel the Antiash war machine."
 antiash_pyarxu_title:0 "The Shores of Pyarxu"
 antiash_pyarxu_desc:0 "Taking Pyarxu completes the northern encirclement of Xon. This is a coastal area and while the Antiash never were good sailors we might be able to recruit some locals to our cause."
 antiash_army_title:0 "A Great Army"
 antiash_army_desc:0 "Without a mighty army we will surely be pushed around and eventually conquered."
 antiash_into_title:0 "Into Ga Xal"
 antiash_into_desc:0 "On land, Ga Xal is cut off from the outside world. Our invasions have created a perfect situation to strike and begin the march on Xon."
 antiash_xon_title:0 "Conquer Xon"
 antiash_xon_desc:0 "Back when the Antiash lived solely in the Great Desert no one would have thought that one day glorious Xon will fall to our regiments. Yet here we are, ready to join the list of this mighty city's owners, and loot the various libraries of the city!"
 antiash_prepare_title:0 "Prepare the Attack"
 antiash_prepare_desc:0 "We have made the Great Sanctuary Lake a new home, but it is not completely ours. The Totinos tribe prevents us from colonising the much drier, but still valuable eastern coast. They must be chased out."
 antiash_settle_title:0 "Settle the East Bank"
 antiash_settle_desc:0 "With the Totinos gone the the east bank is open for settlement, and the lake can truly be called ours."
 antiash_population_title:0 "Large Population"

 antiash_delkum_title:0 "Cross the Delkum Desert"
 antiash_delkum_desc:0 "Our way through the wasteland should be made easier by the reclamation of a former Delkian settlement abandoned after the Oppian war. They considered it not worth sustaining, but we are desert people and know better!"

 antiash_ximal_title:0 "Siege Ximal"
 antiash_ximal_desc:0 "Only the capture of Marn is needed to connect our possesions with Maky. The ancient city of Ximal towers over this hard to traverse area and it's defences will come in useful once an Antiash garnison moves in."
 antiash_calla_title:0 "Drought in Vinia"
 antiash_calla_desc:0 "It is ironic that a region famous for worshipping water will fall under the rule of desert people? Seizing this region will enable us to use the other important element of Ga Xalian culture - high quality mercenaries, who should have no problem with helping us reach our goals."
 antiash_relxal_title:0 "Reach Relxal"

 antiash_kinvirel_title:0 "Own Kinvirel"
 antiash_kinvirel_desc:0 "We've made it so far it would be a shame to not go a little further and conquer Kinvirel, a rich trading city and the first democracy in Jasua. Perhaps their knowledge will help us better run the country."

 antiash_yabonia_title:0 "Yabonian Drylands"

 antiash_invite_title:0 "Invite Metallurgists"
 antiash_invite_desc:0 "If we want to become a great nation we cannot be behind the rest of the world - withouth metallurgy. Any country foolish enough to befriend us will surely send their experts to our homeland."
 antiash_reform_title:0 "Reform Bosisi"
 antiash_reform_desc:0 "The Bosisi faith is a very primitive and unorganized one. Every province worships it's own, slightly altered version, human sacrifices often happen without any good reasoning and there is no religious hierarchy. This makes governing our country much more difficult than it could be. It is the responsibility of the king to take control and reform our religion according to the northern model."
 antiash_culture_title:0 "Develop Antiash Culture"
 antiash_culture_desc:0 "We need to prove that the Antiash aren't just bloodthirsty raiders from some backwater region. Our capital will become a shining beacon, inhabited by architects, mathematicians and the like."

 antiash_promote_title:0 "Advertise Antiash Cotton"
 antiash_promote_desc:0 "As far as we are aware, the Great Sanctuary Lake is the only region producing large amounts of cotton. If we popularised this product among the Gomic elite we would earn lots of money."
 antiash_kashroon_title:0 "Rebuild Kashroon"
 antiash_kashroon_desc:0 "The ancient Kashroonian temple has fallen, but it can be rebuilt and repurposed for the Bosisi faith, which isn't so different from the Mak or Kashroonic beliefs. We will proclaim to the world that the ancient Gomic religion isn't dead!"
 antiash_ganush_title:0 "Appease the Ganush"
 antiash_ganush_desc:0 "The Ganushan are fiery and warlike people. To gain their respect and trust we need to prove that we can wage war for battles and honor itself."
 antiash_kurkari_title:0 "Appease the Kurkari"
 antiash_kurkari_desc:0 "Kurkaris are divided into many powerful factions. We should ally themselves with some and persecute the undesirables. They will have no choice but to take up arms and their fate will be sealed."
 antiash_manthwar_title:0 "Appease the Manthwari"
 antiash_manthwar_desc:0 "The Manthwari have become linked to the merchant class of our country so much that in some areas being a trader and being a Manthwari is interchangeable. Therefore, if to please them we need to please the burghers."
 antiash_ashdamir_title:0 "Appease the Ashdamiri"
 antiash_ashdamir_desc:0 "The Ashdamiri people have been complaining that they got the smallest and least habitable piece of land after the migration. To fix this problem leaders of their major clans found a beautiful area in Delkia. They give us a deal - if we prepare it for their settlement they will swear loyalty."
 antiash_happy_tribes_title:0 "The Great Meeting"
 antiash_happy_tribes_desc:0 "Now that all four tribes are content and ready to cooperate, we can hold a great meeting and reform to realm."

 #Desert Tribe Missions
 destribe_search_for_water_title:0 "Search for Water"
 destribe_search_for_water_desc:0 "The main reason why the few clans who live in the Great Desert are required to migrate so much is to search for water.

 destribe_leave_the_desert_title:0 "Leave the Desert"
 destribe_leave_the_desert_desc:0 "The main thing holding our society back is the lack of water. If we were to maybe migrate out of this endless saltflat desert, we could build a larger settlement."

 gadea_find_converts_title:0 "Recruit the Converts"
 gadea_find_converts_desc:0 "Although they are heretics who tried to destroy our region, the Ravshans are no doubt masters of Cavalry combat. As we slowly reclaim some lands where their descandants roam, we should give military jobs to the Ravshan bands who are willing to convert to our faith."

 gadea_centralise_all_vassals_desc:0 "Although we now have many, many tributaries under our control, they still have too much autonomy. It is time to change this, and closer integrate all Gadan nations into our country."
 gadea_oppia_title:0 "Into Oppia"
 gadea_oppia_desc:0 "To our West lies the civilisation of Oppia. It was under their empire that the Opmaki people and Gadan religion first arose. It is now time to return the favour and enlighten them in return."
 gadea_council_title:0 "Council of Gadea"
 gadea_council_desc:0 "Now that immediate matters have been taken care of, it is time to excercise some of our religious authority. We will ask all Gadan leaders to submit to our authority. We may however need to do... more violent methods of perusuasion to get convince some of them."
 gadea_wipe_heretics_title:0 "Wipe out the Heretics"
 gadea_wipe_heretics_desc:0 "Even though we are now the official leader of the Gadan religion, some leaders refuse to accept our objective rule. They must be reminded with force on who they are here to serve."
 gadea_centralise_title:0 "Integrate the Tributaries"
 gadea_centralise_desc:0 "Even as the leader of the Gadan faith, our subjects are still fairly distant from the Bishop. We may need to excercise some political maneouvering to bring them closer to our Holy Government."
 gadea_gadelis_title:0 "Form Gadelis"
 gadea_gadelis_desc:0 "The name 'Gadelis' comes from Gadea, our capital, plus the Opmaki suffix '-lis' meaning kingdom. We are no longer a puny city state - we are more like a kingdom, but with a Bishop for a king!"
 gadea_one_faith_title:0 "The One Faith"
 gadea_one_faith_desc:0 "We would've never imagined that our conversions would have gone as well as it has gone so far. We must expand this globally, and ensure we are the only faith left!"
 gadea_develop_holy_city_title:0 "Develop the Holy City"
 gadea_develop_holy_city_desc:0 "We intend to make Gadea into the City of Cities, a world-class world metropolis to support the Gadan world. But we must start small. Investing into basic developments for a city overlooked by Xalian authorities will be a good start."
 gadea_build_army_title:0 "Build an Army"
 gadea_build_army_desc:0 "If we are to confront our enemies, we should have an impressive army to match. More soldiers; more generals; let the aristocrats pay for forts. While we will cover it as a 'defensive' force, in reality we will use it to convert heathens at swordpoint."
 gadea_conscript_from_subjects_title:0 "Conscript from Subjects"
 gadea_conscript_from_subjects_desc:0 "While we are a small nation, we have many Gadean leaders who would be more than happy to supply us with their troops. We just need to ensure that our army is already fit to this more decentralised levvy format."
 gadea_justify_ale_mea_title:0 "Justify war on Ale Mea"
 gadea_justify_ale_mea_desc:0 "Ale Mea has been our greatest threat so far. A thorn in the back of the Holy City, our capital is merely miles away from their land. This cannot stand, they must fall!"
 gadea_morsum_for_peace_title:0 "Morsum for Peace"
 gadea_morsum_for_peace_desc:0 "The Morians, just as us, have been a historically opressed minority. If we defeat Ale Mea and occupy their cities, we might be able to strike up a deal to gain them independence, at the cost of them converting from their heretical religion."
 gadea_jasua_title:0 "Into Jasua"
 gadea_jasua_desc:0 "To our East lies the civilisation of Jasua, or Kisholi as the Tonmo call it. In the distant past, the Oppian Empire, under which we arose, invaded the region, and the Oppian Emperor famously proclaimed himself the Jasuan Emperor. We shall follow in his footsteps."
 gadea_develop_gadan_title:0 "Develop Gadan lands"
 gadea_develop_gadan_desc:0 "Although we intent to spread our religion and evangelise the heathens, we still need to take care of home business. The Opmaki core of our nation should not be neglected, and the riches we are gaining should be used to improve our quality of life."
 gadea_control_trade_title:0 "Control Xalian Trade"
 gadea_control_trade_desc:0 "Gadea is in a lucky position, right between Oppia and Ga Xal. If we play this right, we can gain total control of the trade flowing between the regions, and put our own tariffs on it."
 gadea_build_up_region_title:0 "Build up Gadea"
 gadea_build_up_region_desc:0 "We must expand, and spend money on building many great projects across our lands. Historically our region was a backwater, so it is crucial that we spend money to present ourselves as a rising state."
 gadea_enter_delkia_title:0 "Enter Delkia"
 gadea_enter_delkia_desc:0 "Delkia is another threat to Gadean rule, along with Ale Mea. They have puppeteered the Zeaf in the past, and now try to subvert us. This cannot stand. We must infiltrate their society, and prepare for a quick and decisive assault on these Infidels."
 gadea_conquer_vinia_title:0 "Conquer Ga Vin"
 gadea_conquer_vinia_desc:0 "Gadea is no longer a small, tiny, irrelevant state! We will march into Sixan victorious, and burn their heretical artefacts. What sort of religion worships water? We must show them the truth."

 gadea_dominate_gaxal_desc:0 "Would all the hubris of the Xalians ever predict that it would be us, Opmaki, who rule over them? Certaintly not. Their greedy fists have supressed us for too long. Now it is time to show them how imperialism is done properly."

 lag_feniki_culture_title:0 "Feniki Culture"
 lag_feniki_culture_desc:0 "Following the Lathvy Conversion of Laglon, a new culture is beginning to emerge - the Feniki culture, formed from a combination of Oppian and traditional West Estali cultural traditions. We must drive off the old shackles of Oppian influence, and look forwards to a bright and prosperous future!"
 lag_sense_of_unity_title:0 "A Sense of Unity"
 lag_sense_of_unity_desc:0 "The Lathvy Conversions and the rise of the Feniki proved controversial among our people. We must remind the citizens of Laglon that we are one united nation for the Feniki people, and their foremost representative."

 lag_beyond_the_highlands_desc:0 "The Durooma mountains dominate the southern portion of Western Estal. We must climb them, and surpass them in spreading our influence - and our faith - North."
 lag_settle_the_frontier_title:0 "Settle the Frontier"
 lag_settle_the_frontier_desc:0 "Porlyoda is a heavily forested region inhabited mostly by pagan tribes. With our expedition to this area, it has become clear that it needs to be civilised under our infleunce, ensuring that the tribes swear loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 lag_shores_of_the_olivinar_title:0 "Shores of the Olivinar"
 lag_shores_of_the_olivinar_desc:0 "The Western Ordics used to be a grand civilisation before the Hasian Invasions. Nowadays, they are considered second to the Nabrozca-dominated Ordican Empire. Should we integrate them, we could use their help to fight Ordica, as well as make use of access to the Olinivar sea."
 lag_commandeer_the_channel_title:0 "Monopolize Yuvlan Channel"
 lag_commandeer_the_channel_desc:0 "The Yuvlan Channel is a very thin and narrow straight leading into the Slapni sea. Without it, the Nevians, Walarans and Southern Ordica would lack good sea access. It is hence a lucrative trading chokepoint, the control of which would benefit us immensely."
 lag_feyel_and_woch_title:0 "Feyel and Woch"
 lag_feyel_and_woch_desc:0 "Feyel and Woch were nations established by the first lathvy Feniki pioneers who left Laglon and ventured into the Forest. Now that their once-radical ideas have become mainstream in [Root.GetName], we should integrate them back into our society - and make use of the infrastructure they built."
 lag_face_the_barbarians_title:0 "Face the Barbarians"
 lag_face_the_barbarians_desc:0 "Miris is a land of highlanders who have stayed isolated from outside contact until now. Even if the Mainland Oppians claim to have their best interests at heart with colonialist expeditions, it is us, their lowland brethren, who will enlighten them to the Lathvy faith."
 lag_expel_hasia_title:0 "Expel the Monsters"
 lag_expel_hasia_desc:0 "In the past, Hasia rose and killed millions across West Estal. Even though a lot of time has passed, the people of Laglon remember. We must stop this from ever happening again - the Hasians will be destroyed!"

 lag_dominate_west_estal_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is now, without a shadow of the doubt, one of the Great Empires of the world. To cement this legacy, we must clean up the rest of our subcontinent and bring it under [Root.GetAdjective] rule."

 lag_the_war_for_walara_desc:0 "The Walarans are a highlander people who would like to contest us in our invasions of former Pextoglazians. We cannot allow this; we must first beat them on their own playing field in the mountains of Jinasa before we end their state for good."
 lag_invade_the_north_title:0 "Invade the North"
 lag_invade_the_north_desc:0 "Following the fall of Jinasa, we have left open a wide gap for us to take Vapalim, the Walaran capital. We should go further, and conquer along the ridge of the entire Nevian mountains to ensure our countrol over the sea of Slapni."
 lag_deal_with_the_guilds_title:0 "Deal with the Guilds"
 lag_deal_with_the_guilds_desc:0 "Laglon was initially founded as a series of trading outposts by the Oppian Empire. It mostly grew due to merchant influence, and these merchants have stayed until now. They must be made to remember one thing though - Laglon is, first and foremost, a monarchy and the Merchants will not interfere with that."
 lag_the_question_of_slavery_title:0 "The Question of Slavery"
 lag_the_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "One of the main reasons that Laglon grew was due to the Slave Trade of mostly native Estali populations such as the Satryans and Iloosians into Oppia. While it brings us money, scholars have began to argue that it is an immoral practice and should be abolished; meanwhile, the merchants wish for us to expand it further, as it is a significant contributor to our economy. A choice stands before us."
 lag_claim_the_great_city_title:0 "Claim the Great City"
 lag_claim_the_great_city_desc:0 "Quanex is the ancient capital of the Oppian Empire, and it merely sits exposed across the Channel. Once, it was from there that Laglon was ruled with an iron fist; now, it is time for us to take control of the Mainland, and make sure they will never subjugate the citizens of [Root.GetName] again!"
 lag_capture_gineazia_title:0 "Capture Gineazia"
 lag_capture_gineazia_desc:0 "The Southern Glasians are a mercantile people, with the ports of Maglazios being some of the most lucrative trading hubs of the Gomic. On our quest to dominate Pextoglazia - or what's left of it - we will need to integrate their land in our prospective Empire."
 lag_lomean_conquest_title:0 "Lomean Conquest"
 lag_lomean_conquest_desc:0 "On our road to the holy city of Pomlen, the Lomeans stand in our way. With their integration into [Root.GetName], the entirety of the Glasian people will be Resteman."
 lag_raid_on_pomlen_title:0 "Raid on Pomlen"
 lag_raid_on_pomlen_desc:0 "Pomlen is the last refuge of Pextoglazia. The Great Temple stands as a monument to the once tyrannical clerical Empire that ruled the Walarans, Pextans and Glasians. Once we conquer the city, we will need to decide on how to handle the remnants of Pextoglazia."
 lag_the_resteman_perspective_title:0 "The Resteman Perspective"
 lag_the_resteman_perspective_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is now undoubtedly the most legitimate Lathvy state in the world. As times change, so does faith; and ours is growing outdated. We will call up a council of the best theologians from across the Lathvy world, and establish a new doctrine."
 lag_sponsor_fishermen_title:0 "Sponsor Fishermen"
 lag_sponsor_fishermen_desc:0 "The fishermen of Laglon have historically suffered poor returns due to Oppian competition, Even after winning Independence, our fishermen could only sit and watch as the Quanexites fished their wages away. Not anymore. With the start of our Grand Fleet, and enough money poured into our fishing business, soon it will be the Oppians who will scramble for fish returns."
 lag_develop_the_coastline_title:0 "Develop the Coastline"
 lag_develop_the_coastline_desc:0 "Thanks to the Outer Gomic Isles, the western coast of Oppia is rather tame, allowing cities like Umzat, Imogua and Quanex to spring up. Laglon's coast is much the same; albeit more wild and untamed. We will invest into building more coastal infrastructure and supporting the growth of our Navy."
 lag_expand_the_inland_cities_title:0 "Expand the Inland Cities"
 lag_expand_the_inland_cities_desc:0 "Laglon prides itself as a coastal nation; yet, most of our population lives away from the coast. While Esmekeed and Druviked are built on estuaries and lakes merely miles from the coast, there are other cities where travel to the coast can take much longer. We must not forget about them, and develop them equally."
 lag_control_the_channel_title:0 "Control the Channel"
 lag_control_the_channel_desc:0 "So far, our Great Navy has only sailed around our own Coast. The Oppians, despite their arrogance, still have more money than us and can afford to field larger navies, even if they're of worse quality. We have spent years now building up our fleet and mastering ship-building practices. It is time to cross the channel into their waters and show them who really rules the waves!"
 lag_subjugate_cegon_title:0 "Subjugate Gegon"
 lag_subjugate_cegon_desc:0 "Gegon, a Glasian frontier colony, is our first step in Estali expansion. While it is currently under Pextoglazian rule, with the instability of their nation this might change soon, allowing us to begin [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Imperial Ambitions."
 lag_annex_tegaria_title:0 "Annex Tegaria"
 lag_annex_tegaria_desc:0 "On our journey to dominate the Pextoglazians who have laughed at us for so long, Tegaria is next to be brought under the fold. The nobles might scoff at the thought of [Root.GetAdjective]s ruling their domain, but their subjects will surely cheer."
 lag_land_in_arlenta_title:0 "Land in Arlenta"
 lag_land_in_arlenta_desc:0 "Arlenta is one of the most important trading hubs of Oppia. Gromash, Neches and the new city of Arlen move some of the most Oppian cargo per year. In the past, Arlenta was ruled by the tyrannical Orabus dynasty which was destroyed by the Sar, and their opinion in Oppia remainds low. In terms of returning to the mainland, Arlenta is thus a perfect first place to land."
 lag_secure_new_pexamol_title:0 "Secure New Pexamol"
 lag_secure_new_pexamol_desc:0 "New Pexamol was one of the first places colonised by the Pextans during their over-sea migration. While mostly forgotten nowadays, it can serve as a fleet base in the Xalian sea."
 lag_build_ports_title:0 "Build Ports"
 lag_build_ports_desc:0 "Laglon is a coastal nation; our strength is in ports. More docks means more cargo moved, more trade money gained - and a larger navy fielded."
 lag_the_unsinkable_fleet_title:0 "Unsinkable Fleet"
 lag_the_unsinkable_fleet_desc:0 "If we wish to survive and compete with the Mainland Oppians, we must build up a Grand Fleet to rival theirs. As we are natually a seafaring people with a large coast, this shouldn't be that much of a problem."
 lag_improve_naval_leadership_title:0 "Improve Naval Leadership"
 lag_improve_naval_leadership_desc:0 "Our Navy is now significantly more experienced. It is possibly the best in the world. We will use what we have learnt from years at sea, and use that to inform policy in our meritocratic navy-state."
 lag_friends_in_oppia_title:0 "Friends in Oppia"
 lag_friends_in_oppia_desc:0 "Laglon might be isolated from Oppia, especially following our secession, but we are still Oppians at heart. Let us make strong allies on the Mainland that will advocate our cause for us - and help with our expansion."
 lag_into_the_fray_title:0 "Into the Fray"
 lag_into_the_fray_desc:0 "We are returning to Oppia! No longer will Laglon be under miserable Oppian Rule - instead, it will be the Oppians who shall be liberated of their tyrranical Kings and Darli, and all under the hand of the [Root.GetAdjective] Navy."
 lag_overshadow_oppia_title:0 "Overshadow the Oppians"
 lag_overshadow_oppia_desc:0 "We are now greater than the Oppian Empire ever was. We have forged a new Empire of our own, and perhaps it is time to give it a new name to better reflect all the territory we have conquered."

 zea_raise_banners_desc:0 "Zeaf is a nation still mostly dependent on the old tribal clan structure, being the Zeaf Clan it is named after. Now that we have an opening to spread reclaim Maky, we must call upon the people of our nation and rise to arms!"
 zea_into_the_delta_title:0 "Into the Delta"
 zea_into_the_delta_desc:0 "We were exiled from Maky during the regional Makyan administration in the days of the Oppian Empire. While the Oppian Emperors supported our ethnic and religious movement, the Makyan lords saw us as a threat, and so the Oppians couldn't do anything to not transgress their vassals and potentially cause them to revolt. This has changed. With three entire Empires fallen, Maky and the Opmaki lands are divided, and we have an oppurtunity to return to our homeland."
 zea_rule_makyna_title:0 "Rule the Makyna"
 zea_rule_makyna_desc:0 "The Makyna River has some of the most fertile soil in the Gomic. For many years, foreign Empires have ruled over the Delta to capitalise on its exports of materials such as grain, wine, flowers, tea, etc. We will safeguard these exports, while at the same time dissolving the predatory Mak noble class, and enforcing our own Tribal administration."
 zea_holy_cities_title:0 "The Holy Cities"
 zea_holy_cities_desc:0 "In the past, Gadan prophets lived in several Makyan cities. They were of course shunned, and eventually our believers were driven out. Unbeknownst to the false believers, they went on to become some of the most powerful Spirits in the afterlife. We have returned to their homeland, and we will dedicate shrines in the honour of these martyrs."
 zea_opmaki_domination_title:0 "Opmaki Domination"
 zea_opmaki_domination_desc:0 "At last, the Opmaki are back home. We have wiped out the Mak heathens, and are spreading our cultural revolution. As we do so, we accumulate more and more tribes and clans under our umbrella, from which we can excercise our power."
 zea_consolidate_opmaki_title:0 "Consolidate the Opmaki"
 zea_consolidate_opmaki_desc:0 "We are not the only Opmaki clan. Several others have formed their own states, from the Makyan-influenced state of Zak to the Xalnish converts in Ga Tsal. We however remain the oldest clan, the oldest Gadan region, and unlike the other states, still stick to old Makyan clan structure."
 zea_enter_gadea_title:0 "Enter Gadea"
 zea_enter_gadea_desc:0 "After the first Gadan converts were expelled from Maky, they settled and founded the city of Gadea. But, as time went on, one empire led to another and the city was put under Xalnish Administration. Many fled south, with the Zeaf clan having been the first, and lands inhabited by our clan became the first region in the world to adopt Gadan on a widespread scale. With the spread of Gadan under the Neo-Xalnish Empire, believers eventually returned to Gadea, where religious authorities now reside. To show our goodwilled intent and piousness, the Zeafs shall become the official patrons of the Holy City."
 zea_turn_on_delkia_title:0 "Turn on Delkia"
 zea_turn_on_delkia_desc:0 "Even in the days of the Neo-Xalnish Empire, the Delkians were pulling on our strings. They clearly want to use us to rule over the Opmaki region - what hubris! We shall show them an outcome none of their greedy nobles anticipated, and they will learn to fear the wrath of our Clans!"
 zea_from_the_ruins_title:0 "From the Ruins"
 zea_from_the_ruins_desc:0 "When we first ventured into Maky, we found it annihilated as a result of the Yomtanian wars. However, through charity and goodwill, the Opmaki have rebuilt it, enlightening many to our religion in the process. As we continue to rebuild, we will sponsor the construction of world-class silk manufactories around the trade port of Makykay."

 ### TCK MISSIONS

 tck_restore_umzat_title:0 "Restore Umzat"
 tck_restore_umzat_desc:0 "The Sar Dynasty has been able to rise to reclaim Quanex from the Lathvy occupiets, but our ambitions are much greater. The Kingdom of Umzat in the south is an artificial nation that has arisen out of the Merchant Classes of the Quanex Realm. In our quest to finally restore the Oppian Empire, we must start by installing ourselves as the rightful ruler, restoring the old Imperial Province - or Konusate - of Umzat."
 tck_umzatian_shipyards_title:0 "Umzatian Shipyards"
 tck_umzatian_shipyards_desc:0 "Our dominion over Umzat will enable us to brush off the dust from the chaotic post-Imperial era, and put it back to good use. In particular, new shipbuilding techniques will not only enable us to field a larger navy, but explore further along the Outer Gomic Islands."
 tck_new_umzat_title:0 "New Umzat"
 tck_new_umzat_desc:0 "We have made landfall in a region the natives call Miris! Many of our Umzatian subjects are eager to exploit this new land for what it's worth. We shall set up an Oppian Colony and bring back great Riches."
 tck_carvel_shipbuilding_title:0 "Carvel Shipbuilding"
 tck_carvel_shipbuilding_desc:0 "The traditional method of Shipbuilding is the Clinker Technique, where planks are layered on one another. However, some of our great Engineers have discovered a new method that could be potentially far more effective - the Carvel technique. If applied, our ships will be much more durable and ferocious in combat."
 tck_mines_of_fasalep_title:0 "Mines of Fasalep"
 tck_mines_of_fasalep_desc:0 "Fasalep is a massive exporter of metals as well as Jewellery. If we encourage the exporting of raw resources, we can grow the Basin's mining industry drastically."
 tck_vielan_vinyards_title:0 "Vineyards of Viela"
 tck_vielan_vinyards_desc:0 "Nutia is well known for its wine exports in Oppia. With the province of Nuti having been restored, we can now start re-importing Imperial Wine into our palaces, as well as selling it abroad for huge profits."
 tck_take_out_accaci_title:0 "Take out the Accati"
 tck_take_out_accaci_desc:0 "The Accati are long-time rivals of the Sar. Although we were forced to temporarily ally with them to wipe out the anomaly state of Arlenta, we Sar keep very good track of our history. The Accati are a cadet branch of the more famous House of Emintas, who have been Sar rivals since before even the Oppian Era, in the age of Myths. While the House of Emintas itself died out during the days of the Empire, the Accati survive and keep claim to their lineage. We must make sure that they do not rise again!"
 tck_reclaim_artefacts_title:0 "The Imperial Artefacts"
 tck_reclaim_artefacts_desc:0 "In our posession is already the famous Crown of Emintas used by Oppian Emperors in the early days. According to what we tell others, it was stolen in the early days of the Empire, and was only recovered after the Fall of Arlenta. Or so that's people outside the House of Sar are told. In reality, the Crown was in our posession, and then used as bait to facilitate the destruction of the Kingdom of Arlenta. Despite this, there are still many Oppian Artefacts that would greatly benefit our legitimacy further if they were recovered too; and this will give us the reputation of preserving history."
 tck_qamon_mercenaries_title:0 "Hire Qamon Mercenaries"
 tck_qamon_mercenaries_desc:0 "Qamon is a vast civilisation, more powerful than us in some aspects. It cannot however be denied that they are masters of cavalry and the sword. We can do well by enlisting some of them into our service."
 tck_bite_giants_title:0 "The Bite Giants"
 tck_bite_giants_desc:0 "Bite Giants are huge, lumbering beasts native to Qamon and Tomba. It undoubtedly gives them an advantage over other civilisations in combat; with our recent enlistment of Qamon Mercenaries, maybe we could learn how to domesticate them too."
 tck_reclaim_minor_darlates_title:0 "Reclaim the Minor Darlates"
 tck_reclaim_minor_darlates_desc:0 "To the East of the Crown Kingdom sit many minor duchies and darlates that broke off during the Quanex Realm's collapse. It is imperative that these minor lords are reminded of their duty in regards to the Crown King, whether by force or diplomacy."

 tck_restore_elorak_desc:0 "Ossor is the strongest of the Post-Imperial nations. However, if Mensel Sar dissolved Arlenta while ruling over a city state; then we can dissolve the strongest pretender of Oppia too, and punish the treasonous Accati too while at it."
 tck_invade_arlenta_title:0 "Invade Arlenta"
 tck_invade_arlenta_desc:0 "It was not long ago when Oppia feared the rising kingdom of Arlenta. Ruled by the former Oppian Imperial Marshal turned noble-wanna be, Ndalma Orabus, it was a pariah state for those wanting to challenge Imperial customs. Many blamed Arlenta for the dissolution of the Oppian Empire, as it was Orabus who began the Arlentan Uprising with help from the Gomic Coalition, one of the key reasons for the end of the Oppian Empire. Mensel Sar, with his diplomatic brilliance, was able to use the Crown of Emintas to stage a false casus belli and justify the dissolution of Arlenta, and the scattering of the Orabus. It is time we end this saga and bring it back under rightful Oppian control - maybe setting an example along the way."
 tck_towards_the_delta_title:0 "Towards the Delta"
 tck_towards_the_delta_desc:0 "Deshmoz is an Oppian State that has been drifting away from Imperial Customs, and while we should set them straight, what lies beyond them is even more important. The Makyan Delta is called the Breadbasket of the Gomic. In the past, Maky inflicted a humiliating series of losses upon the Oppian Empire, and even under the Empire still was ruled by a suberviant King. We shall make no such mistake twice. With the Makyan Anarchy, the region will still be recovering and so won't be able to defend itself from another Oppian Subjugation."
 tck_take_back_laglon_title:0 "Take back Laglon"
 tck_take_back_laglon_desc:0 "Laglon was established first as a series of slave-trading colonies across the strait from Quanex; but it eventually grew to become the richest and most powerful Imperial province by many regards. They immediately became an Oppian Pariah State, after rebelling from the Empire during the Great Gomic War, and housing many of those who disagreed with the system on the mainland. Furthermore, they are abandoning their Oppian identity in favour of their Native Estali one - this is unacceptable. We must remind them of where they come from, and who they must bow to!"
 tck_the_good_king_title:0 "The Good King"
 tck_the_good_king_desc:0 "Mensel Sar was one of the legendary Oppian Statesmen, who not only unshackled Oppia from the rule of a Lathvy invader class in the Quanex Realm, and destroyed the treasonous Kingdom of Arlenta; but also established the Crown Kingdom. which is surely going to re-usher the age of the Oppian Empire. For now though, we must mourn his death, and let his example inspire us to do great things."
 tck_the_sar_dynasty_title:0 "The Sar Dynasty"
 tck_the_sar_dynasty_desc:0 "The Sar dynasty is one of the most prestigious Oppian houses. Our history dates thousands of years; some say that we are descendants of Yorlox himself. The city of Sar was named after us - or we took our name from it, the members of our House argue about the truth. However, it is still our Imperial fief, and we will protect it, just as we protect our entire Family."
 tck_jol_cema_title:0 "Take Jol Cema"
 tck_jol_cema_desc:0 "With Umzatian expeditions to the Outer Gomic Islands, we can't be left out. We should sponsor our own journey to the untapped Outer Isles, and take land for ourselves as well."
 tck_desert_infrastructure_title:0 "Desert Infrastructure"
 tck_desert_infrastructure_desc:0 "The Oppian Desert has not been as well developed as the coastal regions. Travel is still difficult, and many cities are isolated. We should invest into building road networks to speed up transportation, and construct infrastructure to aid our cities."
 tck_eastern_coast_title:0 "Take the Western Coast"
 tck_eastern_coast_desc:0 "Oppia has historically expanded East, towards the centre of civilisation. This however raises the question; what is to our West? We know of the outer Gomic isles and Miris, but the land itself is hostile. We will need to gather a great navy to advance down the coast."
 tck_alakim_river_title:0 "Descend the Alakim"
 tck_alakim_river_desc:0 "The Alakim river begins in Ossor, and flows into the Great Desert. The Desert itself has always been a mystery; hopefully, canoeing down the temperate river will help us to explore more inland into what appears to be an endless desert."
 tck_sea_of_ekelo_title:0 "The Sea of Ekelo"
 tck_sea_of_ekelo_desc:0 "A miracle! As it turns out, the Great Desert is not actually endless! We have made contact with a civilisation on the other side, and it is a ripe time to exchange goods between our civilisations - for extreme profits, of course."
 tck_coronation_title:0 "The Coronation"
 tck_coronation_desc:0 "We have united Oppia, by bringing the rogue nations under our grasp and ensuring control over our own realm. In Oppian culture, an Empire can only be declared by a person who represents the entirety of Oppia. We just so happen to fulfil these requirements; it is time for our official coronation."
 tck_oppian_hegemony_title:0 "Oppian Hegemony"
 tck_oppian_hegemony_desc:0 "All of Oppia, without question, is now under our rule. We have restored the Oppian Empire. Nobody can now question our legitimacy to rule over the southern coast of the Gomic."
 tck_crown_army_title:0 "The Crown Army"
 tck_crown_army_desc:0 "Our army has always been in, to put it bluntly, poor shape. We should use our new prestigious position to scout out military talent and reform our army. We will no longer be laughed at on the battlefield!"
 tck_oppian_siege_weaponry_title:0 "Oppian Siege Weaponry"
 tck_oppian_siege_weaponry_desc:0 "The Oppian Empire perfected the Vanomatis Catapult, and employed it extensively in the late stages of the Empire's lifespan. It is a shame that in the dark ages that followed, its use died out. As the rightful descendants of the Empire, we will bring it back into use. There will be no castle which can resist our catapults!"
 tck_new_model_army_title:0 "New Model Army"
 tck_new_model_army_desc:0 "Through careful reform and building a modern, post-imperial army we have come to dominate Oppia. We will build up our entire army according to this new model; let the other nations of the Gomic weep with their shoddily trained mercenary bands as our grand Legions wash over them like a tidal wave!"
 tck_finest_diplomats_title:0 "The Finest Diplomats"
 tck_finest_diplomats_desc:0 "Our situation is procarious. We struggle to govern our small domain, and our influence is minimal. Despite this, we are well known diplomatically, especially thanks to the late Mensel Sar. Let everyone in Oppia learn to love us!"
 tck_sar_power_title:0 "Secure Sar Power"
 tck_sar_power_desc:0 "The Sar dynasty are the undisputed Kings of the Crown Kingdom - but what good does that do if we can't excercise our power? If we are truly the descendant of the absolutist Oppian Emperors, we will rule our state accordingly. Let the nobles and merchant guilds know of their disposability if they try to rebel!"
 tck_provencial_governors_title:0 "Appoint Governors"
 tck_provencial_governors_desc:0 "We have grown much, and so we must take a page from the history books. The Oppian Empire maintained its large size through the Konusates, or imperial Provinces. We have restored some of the Provinces, but they are no more than puppet states. We must integrate them further, while decentralising our own land in the Oppian Model, which will overcome the challenges of governing such a large territory."
 tck_wipe_out_pretenders_title:0 "Wipe out the Pretenders"
 tck_wipe_out_pretenders_desc:0 "Although most people will agree to our rule on Oppia, there are still those who might try to subvert our legitimacy. We must wipe all of them out, so that only we remain as legitimate claimants to the old Empire."
 tck_build_up_river_title:0 "Develop the Rivers"
 tck_build_up_river_desc:0 "Oppian Civilisation developed most around the Quanex Peninsular. However, this is a region which is growing increasingly more crowded, as well as suffering devastating weather. To our south, the riverlands offer fertile farmland ripe for expansion. We will settle these lands more extensively to alleviate population pressures in the north."
 tck_flood_barriers_title:0 "Build the flood barriers"
 tck_flood_barriers_desc:0 "The coastal cities, especially Quanex, are extremely vulnerable to storms due to their position. We must invest a significant amount of time and money into building flood barriers to stop extensive damage to these settlements."
 tck_rebuild_temples_title:0 "Rebuild the Temples"
 tck_rebuild_temples_desc:0 "Many of the Great Temples were destroyed in the collapse of the Oppian Empire; many others still in the Yomtanian Wars. If we want to show our devotion to the Gods, we must restore their former glory."
 tck_oppian_schism_title:0 "On the Schism"
 tck_oppian_schism_desc:0 "A great religious war is taking place across Oppia; between the traditionalists and the reformists. We must pick a side and enforce it nationally."
 tck_reconcile_religion_title:0 "Reforming our Religion"
 tck_reconcile_religion_desc:0 "The Oppian religion is growing more dated by the day. We must host a council and review current religious practices - which might even include changes to the great Oppian pantheon itself."
 tck_oppian_schools_title:0 "Build Oppian Schools"
 tck_oppian_schools_desc:0 "An educated upper class is essential to running an Empire. We will build new schools for the aristocracy, which will help us govern our nation."
 tck_oppian_economics_title:0 "Oppian Economics"
 tck_oppian_economics_desc:0 "Oppia has a weird position in the trade routes of the Gomic. We are more of a net producer than a net importer, which facilitated our expansion in the past. If we dominate all the hubs of production, we can hold a monopoly on Oppian Goods, and charge great fees for merchants wanting to sell them abroad."
 tck_gates_of_gomic_title:0 "The Gates of the Gomic"
 tck_gates_of_gomic_desc:0 "We hold total control over the only known entrance and exit of the Gomic Sea. All trade that flows in from Ordica, Naravam, Vordor, Saka, even as far as Hasmal or Agmagoz - it must pass through us first. This gives us an incredibly lucrative chance to make great profits off taxing incoming Goods."
 tck_ravsho_mercs_title:0 "Hire Ravsho Mercenaries"
 tck_ravsho_mercs_desc:0 "It is no doubt that Ravsho people are some of the best cavalrymen in the world. They swiftly cut down Jasua, and we can forgive their pagan religion if they enlist to fight for us in our wars."
 tck_revolutionised_cav_title:0 "Revolutionise Cavalry"
 tck_revolutionised_cav_desc:0 "After fighting alongside Ravshan Mercenaries, our commanders have learnt much about radical new cavalry tactics. If applied correctly, we can dominate in the realm of horseback warefare."
