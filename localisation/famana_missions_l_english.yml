 van_technological_advantage_title:0 "Technological Advantage"
 van_technological_advantage_desc:0 "Vanoma and technology go hand in hand. Ever since the establishment of the University of Montava, knowledge has always been highly valued. If we make additional technological strides, we may be able to gain a significant advantage over our barbarian neighbors."
 van_colonize_borlebin_title:0 "Settle the Eastern Plains"
 van_colonize_borlebin_desc:0 "To our east is a lightly settled grassland area, populated by uncivilized tribes. Colonizing it ourselves would bring us closer to the Aresians, allowing us to trade with them, or maybe engage in some less peaceful endeavors."

 #Kinvireli Missions
 kin_theory_of_helvania_title:0 "Theory of Helvania"
 kin_theory_of_helvania_desc:0 "The Theory of Helvania was invented centuries ago in Ancient Vaximor.

It is vital that we preserve these values and do not succumb to autocracy like the rest of Jasua."
 kin_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"

 kin_the_lathvy_question_title:0 "The Lathvy Question"
 kin_the_lathvy_question_desc:0 "The question of the Lathvy faith has plagued Kinvirel for years. Many in the country choose follow this new religion, especially in the northern cities. While the faith is completely tolerated in Kinvirel and sometimes mixes with local pagan worship, we ought to make up our mind. Should we adopt this religion, or hold on to our old beliefs?"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_title:0 "The One True Faith"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_desc:0 "Our state has finally chosen to adopt a single religion. But the religious problems of Kinvirel are far from over, as many in the country are not fully commited to their faith. To secure religious unity in Kinvirel, we must practice it to its fullest extent."
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_title:0 "Jasuan Religious Unity"
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_desc:0 "Jasua has long been divided along religious lines. In the south, Oppians practiced their own faith. In the north, many converted to the pagan Bamali religion. In Kapolia, Lathvy reigned supreme. This religious division is no more! Our ruler has seen to it that every Jasuan worships the same gods."
 kin_end_the_dark_age_title:0 "End the Dark Age"
 kin_end_the_dark_age_desc:0 "For far too long, Jasua has been mired in poverty and division. Ever since the Oppio-Jasuan War, the cities and roads of Jasua, once the greatest in the world, have been neglected and are now in a truly deplorable state. The Dark Age of Jasua has gone on for long enough. We are now in a position to finally reunite Jasua under one state, bringing an end to the current state of affairs so that we may rebuild and reclaim our status as a Gomic great power."
 kin_expel_mahansha_title:0 "Expel Mahansha"
 kin_expel_mahansha_desc:0 "Mahansha is a pest for the entire Eastern Gomic. Their ships raid and pillage the coasts of Jasua and beyond indiscriminately. This cannot be allowed to continue, so Mahansha must be driven out of Jasua."
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_title:0 "Defeat Zoblotra"
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_desc:0 "Our conquest of Mahansha has shown that our army is capable of fighting back against the Oppians. With this in mind, it would seem foolish not to attack the weak Zoblotrans to our south."
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_title:0 "Gomic Coffee Monopoly"
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_desc:0 "Coffee has never been an important export of Kinvirel. Spices and paper have always overshadowed our small coffee plantations. But now that we have conquered parts of the Hoxoi Coast, it is becoming clear that we are in control of the entire Gomic's supply of these precious beans. Perhaps this should be taken advantage of."
 kin_pacify_bamal_title:0 "Pacify Bamal"
 kin_pacify_bamal_desc:0 "The Bamali people, once an ally of ours, have been integrated into our realm. We must secure our hold on the region before we expand further northward."
 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_title:0 "Reforging the Jasuan Empire"
 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_desc:0 "The time has come to restore the mighty Jasuan Empire. The new empire, having regained the former glory of the old, will soon come to overshadow its predecessor. As we expand along the shores of the Gomic, we will spread the noble ideals of Jasua. The new golden age of Jasua is upon us."
 kin_hinder_yabonia_title:0 "Hinder Yabonia"
 kin_hinder_yabonia_desc:0 "To our east lumbers the giant Kingdom of Yabonia. Stronger than our puny republic, yet severely overstretched, Yabonia may be difficult to defeat. But with a strong army and the help of allies, we may just be able to."
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_title:0 "Onward to Jimkalin"
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_desc:0 "Our victorious conquest of western Yabonia has greatly weakened our rival and brought us closer to their capital. With these new territories in hand, we have a real claim to the entirety of the Jasuan heartland."
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_title:0 "Neutralize Yabonia"
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_desc:0 "Yabonia will soon be all but destroyed. We have conquered most of their land, and what remains of their pathetic kingdom will soon be wiped out by our grand army. We are now the rulers of the Jasuan heartland, so it is time to take the rest of our rightful territory."
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_title:0 "Unification with Kapolia"
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_desc:0 "Kapolia. The final piece of Jasua, yet unclaimed by our rising republic. Whether through diplomacy or war, we will integrate it into our state."
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_title:0 "Pearl of Jasua"
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_desc:0 "Kinvirel, our capital and most important city, is the greatest city in Jasua and the historic capital. But if we expanded the city even more, Kinvirel could truly be a jewel of the eastern Gomic."
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_title:0 "Sponsor the Merchants"
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_desc:0 "Many of our merchants are struggling to compete with Maxan and Xalnish traders. To secure our hold on the eastern Gomic trade network, we should do everything we could to make their job as easy as possible."
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_title:0 "Eastern Gomic Trade"
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_desc:0 "As the major trading power in the eastern Gomic, we are making a lot of money. However, to truly dominate the trade routes, we need a large merchant fleet."
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_title:0 "Assert Control of Hartimatul"
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_desc:0 "Harmanul, our old trading colony, has always been very important. It is a vital outpost for our merchants, but one thing has always been preventing us from using it as a staging ground for invading the Maxan isles, that being the local Maxan population. To take full advantage of Hartimatul, we must expel the locals and re-settle it with Jasuans."

 fas_venture_westward_desc:0 "Our warriors yearn for glorious combat and precious loot. To find it, we must go west, and bring more than just warriors. We have to expand the Fashran Tonxara."
 fas_ensure_tonmo_unity_title:0 "Ensure Tonmo Unity"
 fas_ensure_tonmo_unity_desc:0 "It is vital that our religion stays united under one school of thought. Different branches splitting off from the central faith would undermine the ambitions of our state."
 fas_reform_the_faith_title:0 "Reform the Faith"
 fas_reform_the_faith_desc:0 "With the power of the Tonxara, we can change the Tonmo religion. While it is obviously the one true religion, how can we be sure we have interpreted it correctly? We should hire a highly enlightened intellectual to figure it out for us. A Tonmo reformation is in order if we want our faith to be more than mere pagan rituals."
 fas_a_final_push_title:0 "A Final Push"
 fas_a_final_push_desc:0 "It is official: the Jasuan cities are real. All that remains to do is expanding our borders to the nearby state of Biliku, connecting us to Jasua. This may take a concerted military effort, but it will be worth it."
 fas_destroy_biliku_title:0 "Destroy Biliku"
 fas_destroy_biliku_desc:0 "Biliku has been eviscerated by our forces! Cities burn, peasants flee, and the loot and glory are ours. The horde has arrived, and will show no mercy."
 fas_conquer_nozumol_title:0 "Conquer Nozumol"
 fas_conquer_nozumol_desc:0 "We have encountered the tribe of Nozumol to our immediate west. They are heathens, plain and simple, following the same faith as the cowardly Geopyopians. Conquering Nozumol will let us expand further westward, in search for more lucrative places to pillage."
 fas_rumors_of_the_west_title:0 "Rumors of the West"
 fas_rumors_of_the_west_desc:0 "Scouts tell of a vast civilization in the west, known primarily as "Jasua". They say it has cities of massive grandeur and wealth, ripe for looting and pillaging. Our warrior chiefs are practically salivating at the notion, so we ought to send a larger scouting party to investigate further."
 fas_the_vanoman_question_title:0 "The Vanoman Question"
 fas_the_vanoman_question_desc:0 "The Vanomans are a curious bunch. They have set up a colony on the coast of the grasslands, which is apparently some kind of trading post. The question on everyone's mind is, how do we deal with this?"
 fas_build_a_navy_title:0 "Build a Navy"
 fas_build_a_navy_desc:0 "With our newfound presence in the Aresian Gulf, and inability to find a northern route to connect the eastern and western coasts, it is imperative that we build a separate navy in the Gulf."
 fas_a_new_capital_title:0 "A New Capital"
 fas_a_new_capital_desc:0 "Our country is no longer a mere tribal confederation cursed with obscurity and poverty. We are now a great empire stretching from west to east over a great length of territory. We rule many different peoples in many different lands. Anmoea may not be the right choice for our capital anymore. Something more central could be better."
 fas_dimdivu_docks_title:0 "Dimdivu Docks"
 fas_dimdivu_docks_desc:0 "To claim naval hegemony over the Aresian Gulf, we need a proper home base for our fleet. Dimdivu will do nicely for this purpose."
 fas_pillage_kinvirel_title:0 "Pillage Kinvirel"
 fas_pillage_kinvirel_desc:0 "Kinvirel, the so-called pearl of Jasua, has been claimed for the Tonxara! Here, the greatest treasures of Jasua can be found. We have found records of Jasuan technology, which we will steal. We have also found many priceless Jasuan artifacts, which we will of course also pilfer from the city."
 fas_raid_jimkalin_title:0 "Raid Jimkalin"
 fas_raid_jimkalin_desc:0 "Yabonia has been a thorn in our side for years now. One of the strongest Jasuan states, it has been hard to defeat. But now that we have taken the capital city of Jimkalin, we can finally claim victory. We shall destroy this city, raze it to the ground until nothing remains but ash. Without this city, Yabonia will crumble."
 fas_defeat_yabonia_title:0 "Defeat Yabonia"
 fas_defeat_yabonia_desc:0 "Yabonia is collapsing before us, and we must take advantage. Sweeping up the remnants of the Yabonian state will allow us to also conquer the squabbling warlords of southern Jasua."
 fas_conquer_bamal_title:0 "Conquer Bamal"
 fas_conquer_bamal_desc:0 "Bamal is a rich and central strip of coastline in the southern Aresian Gulf. Taking this land will truly open the floodgates for the horde, allowing us to move into not just Jasua, but Aresia as well."
 fas_into_aresia_title:0 "Into Aresia"
 fas_into_aresia_desc:0 "The Aresians are clearly weak, and a prime target for subjugation to the Tonxara. They are easily defeated in battle, exhibiting poor morale and unwillingness to fight. The war for Aresia will not be a challenging one."
 fas_subjugate_nakoa_title:0 "Subjugate Nakoa"
 fas_subjugate_nakoa_desc:0 "Nakoa is apparently the greatest of the Aresian states. No matter, they are just as weak as the ones we have already fought, and will not be much of a problem for us."
 fas_montavas_treasure_title:0 "Montava's Treasure"
 fas_montavas_treasure_desc:0 "Montava, the legendary capital of Vanoma, is within our reach. Within this city, many technologies we desire can likely be found, such as the secret to how the vanomatis functions."
 fas_the_vanoman_heartland_title:0 "The Vanoman Heartland"
 fas_the_vanoman_heartland_desc:0 "Vanoma is a rich, advanced and innovative culture, and it would be a shame to not bring it into our sphere of influence. By alliance or conquest, we should try to take control of the kingdom."
 fas_develop_the_steppe_title:0 "Develop the Steppe"
 fas_develop_the_steppe_desc:0 "The steppes of Fashros have long been underdeveloped. For a proper, unified society to exist in these harsh grasslands, the territories must be developed. New roads, trading posts and cities will make this place both prosperous and easier to rule."
 fas_great_cities_of_the_east_title:0 "Great Cities of the East"
 fas_great_cities_of_the_east_desc:0 "The eastern portions of the empire constitute the homeland of the Ravsho people. Despite this, there are no great cities in these lands. The cities of Anmoea, Pizuk and Tyma should be among the world's greatest, yet they are not. We must rectify this."
 fas_the_nhoma_tonxara_title:0 "The Nhoman Tonxara"
 fas_the_nhoma_tonxara_desc:0 "We have developed the steppes of Nhoma extensively, building up its local economy and constructing glorious cities. This will allow a centralized state to exert its rule over the region, should the need arise."
 fas_invade_the_hoxoi_coast_title:0 "Invade the Hoxoi Coast"
 fas_invade_the_hoxoi_coast_desc:0 "As we finish our conquest of Jasua, sweeping up the last remnants of independent kingdoms, the question of what is next is one that needs an answer. The best route for further expansion seems to be the Hoxoi Coast, as it should be fairly easy to traverse and may lead to more great civilizations along the western sea."
 fas_plunder_xolnomarka_title:0 "Plunder Xolnomarka"
 fas_plunder_xolnomarka_desc:0 "Some call it Ga Xal, others call it Xolnomarka. It does not matter to us, and it shall be destroyed either way. A wealthy, prosperous and strong civilization exists here, but they are not united. They squabble and fight amongst each other, and this we shall use to our advantage. They, too, will bow to Gaara."
 fas_ga_tonmo_title:0 "Ga Tonmo"
 fas_ga_tonmo_desc:0 "The Xalians are divided when it comes to religion. Their faith seems to be split into 4, which makes them spiritually weaker. This will allow us to introduce the Tonmo faith easily. Their temples can be converted to Tonmo ones, and their clergymen can be replaced with Tonmo missionaries."
 fas_birth_of_the_tonmo_world_title:0 "Birth of the Tonmo World"
 fas_birth_of_the_tonmo_world_desc:0 "The Tonmo world, what was once but a dream, has come to fruition. Diverse, modernized and with a strong leader, our faith and civilization are due to prosper for centuries to come. As said leader, we may reap the rewards."
 fas_fashran_renaissance_title:0 "Fashran Renaissance"
 fas_fashran_renaissance_desc:0 "Ravsho thought once flourished around the campfires of tribal villages. Nowadays, we have been busy conquering and pillaging, leaving little room for thinking. But with our newly consolidated empire, it may be a prime occasion to sponsor Tonmo philosophers. It will be a golden era for Fashros, a renaissance of Ravsho philosophy and art."
 fas_tonmo_science_title:0 "Tonmo Science"
 fas_tonmo_science_desc:0 "Science, a foreign to concept to Ravsho scholars, has been picked up from conquered peoples and adopted into the realm of Ravsho philosophy. Our scholars have made great strides since, in fields such as astronomy and mathematics. No one understands the heavens and the inner workings of the universe as we do."
 fas_the_jafxoi_tonxara_title:0 "The Jafxoi Tonxara"
 fas_the_jafxoi_tonxara_desc:0 "Through conversion to the Tonmo faith, the Xalian elites have been primed to run a Tonxara of their own, should the need arise. After Fashros is gone, the region will remain a bastion of our religion."
 fas_the_three_crowns_title:0 "The Three Crowns"
 fas_the_three_crowns_desc:0 "Nhoma, Jafxoi and Kisholi have been prepared for eventual self-rule. As the days of the Fashran Tonxara appear to be numbered, we can be sure that this was the right choice. Whoever succeeds us will greatly benefit from our forward thinking."
 fas_secure_the_empire_title:0 "Secure the Empire"
 fas_secure_the_empire_desc:0 "While we are undoubtedly a great power, our situation is fragile. If we do not act quickly to show our dominance over our neighbors, including our brothers in faith, then our great nation could very well be lost. We must be ruthless, or [Root.GetName] will be assigned to the dustbin of history."
 fas_supremacy_of_the_clouds_title:0 "Supremacy of the Clouds"
 fas_supremacy_of_the_clouds_desc:0 "We have shown our military dominance, but we cannot lead the Tonmo world if we are not the spiritual leader as well. With a wealthy population and strong religious cohesion, we can show ourselves to be the true successor to Fashros."
 fas_crush_kapolia_title:0 "Crush Kapolia"
 fas_crush_kapolia_desc:0 "Kapolia is a great danger to our empire, as their faith is also spreading quickly in Jasua. We cannot tolerate this, so we must destroy the Kapolian state utterly. Getting rid of Kapolia will allow us to establish total religious control of Jasua."
 fas_seize_the_northern_shores_title:0 "Seize Emastaly"
 fas_seize_the_northern_shores_desc:0 "The Emastalians are Lathvy, like the Kapolians. This is an intolerable religion, as it presents a real alternative to the worship of Gaara. Just as Kapolia had to be destroyed, so do the states of Emastaly."
 fas_leaving_the_steppe_title:0 "Leaving the Steppe"
 fas_leaving_the_steppe_desc:0 "While we can trace our heritage to the barbaric Fashran Tonxara, we are a civilized people now. [Root.GetName] is a true settled state with a strong leader and professional army. We have left the life of the steppe nomad behind to flourish as a strong and wealthy empire."
 fas_conversion_of_the_jasuans_title:0 "Conversion of the Jasuans"
 fas_conversion_of_the_jasuans_desc:0 "Jasua is a great void of religion, as the rapid decline in traditional beliefs allows foreign faiths to take hold. The true faith of Tonmo will be this faith, if it can take root in the hearts of the Jasuan people."
 fas_the_kisholi_tonxara_title:0 "The Kisholi Tonxara"
 fas_the_kisholi_tonxara_desc:0 "The conversion of the Jasuans to the Tonmo faith has changed their culture in turn; they are now the Kisholi. This new identity means any new Tonmo state formed in this region will be the strongest of them all."

 kap_the_frontier_desc:0 "Yabonia. One of our foremost rivals, and a prime candidate for the reunification of Jasua.

 kap_kinvirel_1_title:0 "Take Ebinor"
 kap_kinvirel_1_desc:0 "Kinvirel is a city of great historic, cultural and economic significance. If we want to be the one to reunify Jasua, we must secure our control of Kinvirel.

 #Pextoglazian Missions
 pex_obtain_aras_approval_title:0 "Obtain Ara's Blessing"
 pex_obtain_aras_approval_desc:0 "The state of Pextoglazia is based wholly on the lathvy religion. Without Ara's favor, we would have nothing! As it stands, the clergy are not happy with the situation, from which we can infer that Ara is also displeased. To restore the holiness of Pextoglazia, we must take action to ensure that we are following Ara's will."
 pex_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"
 pex_stabilize_the_realm_desc:0 "Despite the unifying faith, Pextoglazia is fundamentally a nation of many peoples. Pextans, Glazians, Walarans and Nevians all inhabit the same kingdom, and in recent years, ethnic tensions have threatened to fracture our increasingly volatile nation. To prevent the dissolution of Pextoglazia, we must crack down on all would-be rebellions. We have no choice but to ensure stability, lest we slide into anarchy and civil war."
 pex_defend_pextoglazia_title:0 "Defend Pextoglazia"
 pex_defend_pextoglazia_desc:0 "Our northern neighbors, the Ordicans, are eyeing our declining dominion with malicious intent. Ordica was once an ally of ours, but it is clear that this is no longer the case. To protect our borderlands, we must expand the army and build new fortifications."
 pex_reorganize_the_army_title:0 "Centralize the Nation"
 pex_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "Pextoglazia is a mess of royally appointed bishops, governors of questionable loyalty, and local clergymen and nobles with their own agendas. To have any chance of repelling an invading force, we have no choice but to rid ourselves of this centralized system at any cost. The king must be granted more power over the nation so that its full might may be wielded against its enemies."
 pex_subdue_the_clergy_title:0 "Subdue the Clergy"
 pex_subdue_the_clergy_desc:0 "The lathvy priests, bishops and scholars that make up the Pextoglazian clergy hold vast power over our country. The Religious Leader, who often gets to choose the next king, has a major say in what decisions are made. Ideally, the power of the clergy should be limited, as it is actively disrupting the ability of the government to react to the problems it faces. With bribes, land seizures and revokations of rights, it may be possible to lessen their power, but it will be costly."
 pex_ensure_diocese_loyalty_title:0 "Ensure Diocese Loyalty"
 pex_ensure_diocese_loyalty_desc:0 "Eastern Pextoglazia is ruled by a collection of state-appointed bishops who, while technically subsurvient to their king, are functionally independent. They serve as arms of the clergy, and their influence runs deep. We must ensure that they are loyal to the king, and the king only, or we risk having our own subjects turned against us by foreign powers."
 pex_prevent_collapse_title:0 "Prevent Collapse"
 pex_prevent_collapse_desc:0 "Having taken several harsh, time-consuming and expensive measures to reform, centralize and mobilize the country, it is now clear that Pextoglazia will survive. The collapse, foreseen by so many, will not come to pass. Pextoglazia will live on, stronger than ever, as the spiritual leader of the lathvy world. The once divided groups of the country now stand as one, despite their many differences."
 pex_sway_the_inner_circle_title:0 "Sway the Inner Circle"
 pex_sway_the_inner_circle_desc:0 "While Pextoglazia is safe for the moment, it will not last forever. The bishops of eastern Pextoglazia are still de facto independent fiefdoms, so we should not give their bishops any opportunities to doubt the legitimacy of the state. Additionally, it is not only the dioceses that have questionable loyalties, but also the local rulers of New Pexamol. The island has been a hotbed of political dissent for a long time, and has even developed its own local culture. We must crush the local institutions and wipe away any semblance of independence from Pomlen."
 pex_integrate_the_walarans_title:0 "Institute Direct Rule"
 pex_integrate_the_walarans_desc:0 "The bishops of Lomea, Hilemo and Tegaria have bent the knee, but the easternmost dioceses remain free from government oversight. To bring these wayward provinces into the fold, we must first dissolve the dioceses of central Pextoglazia. Only then can we force the outer dioceses to relinquish their power. As our generals consider offensives into Ordica and Laglon, we will need the territory of the dioceses as staging grounds."
 pex_the_northern_menace_title:0 "The Northern Menace"
 pex_the_northern_menace_desc:0 "The Ordic dragon is waking up. The Ordicans are considering an invasion of our lands, and we are aware of this. To eliminate this grave threat to our own existance, we have no choice but to go on the offensive. Creating a buffer between the Pextoglazian and Ordican heartlans is the only way for us to truly be safe."
 pex_defeat_ordica_title:0 "Defeat Ordica"
 pex_defeat_ordica_desc:0 "Ordica has been pushed back by our righteous invasion, yet they remain a powerful foe. Southern Ordica still threatens the safety of the Slapni Sea coastline, so we ought to seize it too. With the southern half of Ordica in our hands, they will cease to be a threat in the foreseeable future."
 pex_deal_with_laglon_title:0 "Deal With Laglon"
 pex_deal_with_laglon_desc:0 "Laglon, the former Oppian colony that straddles the Estali coastline to our southwest, is a very interesting strip of territory. With it, we will be able to encroach on mainland Oppia, enabling us to make better trade deals and perhaps even establish a colony. To take control of Laglon, we have to first rip out its most important region, Druviked and its surrounding towns."
 pex_holy_restema_title:0 "Holy Restema"
 pex_holy_restema_desc:0 "Laglon is ours! These lands, formerly pagan but now lathvy, will be handed over to a loyal Feniki government who will enforce our will on the locals.With the help of Holy Restema, we will be able to influence Oppia greatly."
 pex_revenge_on_oppia_title:0 "Revenge on Oppia"
 pex_revenge_on_oppia_desc:0 "The Oppians are nothing if not backstabbing snakes. We could never trust them in the past, so now that we are in a strong position and they are not it stands to reason that we should put an end to Oppia once and for all. They have wronged us time and again, without a care. Once, they stood together, but now they are fractured, and as much as this suits us, it could change. To prevent anything like the Burning of Moxon from happening again, it is our moral imperative to act. Ara calls for Oppia to be destroyed!"
 pex_into_emastalia_title:0 "Into Emastalia"
 pex_into_emastalia_desc:0 "The Emastalian coastline is inhabited by the descendants of Maxan settlers. By seizing the nearby trading city of Riximi, we will be able to launch further invasions, pushing east along the coast."
 pex_the_holy_coast_title:0 "The Holy Coast"
 pex_the_holy_coast_desc:0 "We have successfully taken control of Emastalia, integrating our brothers in faith into our great lathvy regime. This wealthy and highly strategic shoreline will grant us control of the northern Gomic, allowing further invasions into both the great city of Bohora and our old homeland of Pextum."
 pex_invade_western_ordica_title:0 "Invade West Ordica"
 pex_invade_western_ordica_desc:0 "With control over mainland Ordica, this grants us the opportunity to advance deeper into western Estal. West Ordica is a relatively wealthy region populated mostly by lathvyites. It is only appropriate that we should assert our control there."
 pex_reclaim_the_homeland_title:0 "Reclaim the Homeland"
 pex_reclaim_the_homeland_desc:0 "Pextum is once again ours! The Xalian invaders have been driven out of our ancient home, and it is now in the hands of its rightful rulers. The integration of this territory has facilitated a reconnection with our cousins across the sea, the descendants of those who could not flee the Morian invasions. Although they are now assimilated into Xalnish culture, we will learn to understand each other soon enough."
 pex_defy_syadon_title:0 "Defy Syadon"
 pex_defy_syadon_desc:0 "Syadon Noy and his Nafan armies have risen from what was once the lowly kingdom of Stroktur. He seeks to spread his heretical views and found an empire based on the ideals of the Eclipse movements. Clearly, he must be stopped, and we are the ones who will do have to do it. By conquering Bohora itself, we will put an end to the madness."
 pex_conquer_kapolia_title:0 "Conquer Kapolia"
 pex_conquer_kapolia_desc:0 "The conquest of Bohora has yielded great benefits. The degree of control we now have over the northern Gomic is almost absolute. Yet, there is another interesting prospect nearby. Conquering the lathvy Jasuans of Kapolia would completely secure our dominance over the Gomic Sea, and firmly anchor us in Jasua."
 pex_champion_of_ara_title:0 "Champion of Ara"
 pex_champion_of_ara_desc:0 "We have bested our rivals to the north, and defeated Syadon in battle. We have combatted all forms of heresy and will continue to do so. We are truly the greatest champions of Ara!"
 pex_the_great_crusade_title:0 "The Great Crusade"
 pex_the_great_crusade_desc:0 "Having defeated the Oppians and secured our position as the one true leader of the lathvy faith, it is about time we did something about the heathen barbarians in our backyard. Following decidedly non-lathvy religions, these uncivilized peoples ought to be shown the light of Ara. It is up to them if it will be by will or by force."
 pex_the_lathvy_empire_title:0 "The Lathvy Empire"
 pex_the_lathvy_empire_desc:0 "We have united most of the lathvy world under one flag. As both the spiritual leader and ruler of most lathvyites, we practically control the entire religion. Thus, we might as well make it official. Declaring ourselves as the Lathvy Empire would give us enormous soft power over Estal and beyond. No one could dispute our status as the great empire we really are."
 pex_establish_the_maxan_diocese_title:0 "Establish the Maxan Diocese"
 pex_establish_the_maxan_diocese_desc:0 "Bohora is ours! As we now control all of Moxon's colonies, there are those in our court who suggest we should take it a step further, and launch an invasion of Moxon itself. With Moxon in our hands, we could enforce our beliefs on those who still follow the despicable and heretical Maxan School of Thought."

 #Delkian Missions
 del_expand_the_cites_title:0 "Rebuild Cites"
 del_expand_the_cites_desc:0 "The cities of Delkia were utterly trashed by the Yomtanian armies during the Maxan War. Tragically, even our own capital is in ruins. It is time to begin the rebuilding process, so that our cites will again be the greatest of Ga Xal."
 del_pearl_of_delkia_title:0 "The Holy Capital"
 del_pearl_of_delkia_desc:0 "Ximal was once a mighty city. In the old days, it was a city larger than any other in Ga Xal besides Xon. Now, however, it is but a shadow of its former self, with most of the city having been destroyed. For the glory of Delk, we must rebuild Ximal and let it shine once more!"
 del_propestiy_for_all_title:0 "Prosperity for All"
 del_propestiy_for_all_desc:0 "Many of our people live in miserable shacks near the major cites, missing out on the prosperity enjoyed in the urban centers. All of Delk's subjects must be protected, as they are all children of the earth."
 del_modernize_army_title:0 "Modernize the Army"
 del_modernize_army_desc:0 "Delkia was once, a very long time ago, a strong military power. Today, it is not so. To compete with our rival Xalian powers, we must reform and modernize the army, as well as bring in new talent."
 del_turn_the_tables_title:0 "Turn the Tables"
 del_turn_the_tables_desc:0 "For decades, the Delkian people languished under Oppian rule. It is only appropriate that we take our revenge on the Oppians of Ropinver."
 del_ropinver_conquest_title:0 "Conquer Roklot"
 del_ropinver_conquest_desc:0 "We have a foothold on the Hoxoi Coast, but that is not enough for us to be safe. We must push further eastward to contain the Oppian menace."
 del_makyan_frontier_title:0 "Opmaki Frontier"
 del_makyan_frontier_desc:0 "The Opmaki are a strange people. They are farmers, artisans and warriors, like the three civilizations that mixed to create them. However, they are also first and foremost weak. There is no unified resistance in the region, which will let us conquer it easily. Additionally, an increased presence there may allow us to exert more influence over Zeaf."
 del_deal_with_gadea_title:0 "Deal With Gadea"
 del_deal_with_gadea_desc:0 "Gadea is the home of the heretical Gadan religion. They don't just rejekt Delk, but the three other Xalian gods as well. This we cannot tolerate!"
 del_ruins_of_jagama_title:0 "Seize Jagama"
 del_ruins_of_jagama_desc:0 "Jagama is one of the arteries of the Gomic trade network. While little actual trade gets done there, almost all merchants travelling from Oppia to Ga Xal use the roads in the area. Claiming this strategic strip of land for ourselves would be quite useful. The port of Bava could also be restored, granting us the possibility of projecting power in the Western Gomic."
 del_ideal_borders_title:0 "A Delkian Empire"
 del_ideal_borders_desc:0 "Delkia, long irrelevant and obscure, has risen once again! We have built an empire out of practically nothing, and are now an important player that cannot be ignored."
 del_protect_the_border_title:0 "Northern Raid"
 del_protect_the_border_desc:0 "Sixan is perhaps our greatest rival. To weaken them, we must launch raids against the towns near their capital, or if we are really daring, the capital itself."
 del_sixan_conquest_title:0 "March on Sixan"
 del_sixan_conquest_desc:0 "We will capture Sixan! Taking this city will give us a way to take the rest of Ga Xal, perhaps to unite the entire region."

As for the Mirisans, they have shown that they are a honourable people and deserve a place in Umzatia."

 #Antiash Missions
 antiash_homeland_title:0 "Homeland of the Antiash"
 antiash_homeland_desc:0 "At the beginning of our westward expansion, we have to pass through the native place that we were forced to leave. These are just barren sands, not much more valuable than the rest of the desert, but we may find something of value left behind in the rush. "
 antiash_tokum_title:0 "Colonise Tokum"
 antiash_tokum_desc:0 "Establishing a few settlements on the banks of the southern Makyna before the Makyans take it over will provide us with a good base for attacks on their nations."
 antiash_kars_title:0 "Seize Kars"
 antiash_kars_desc:0 "The Karsians seem to have recovered from the time our raid destroyed their state, although they are now more Makyan than Karsian. Either way, their city will be first on the long list of our conquests in this region."
 antiash_delta_title:0 "Subjugate the Makyna Delta"
 antiash_delta_desc:0 "After marching into Okus the logical next step is the delta with its fertile land and ruins of a former empire. We will accomplish what we failed to do in 185 and the rulers in Makykay will learn that they really are a minor country that falls into the hands of others!"
 antiash_opmaki_title:0 "Attack the Opmaki"
 antiash_opmaki_desc:0 "Occupation of the petty kingdoms of the Opmaki will complete our conquest of Maky allowing us to link up with the invasion force in Ximal and launch a direct attack on Morsum."
 antiash_jexus_title:0 "Central Xalian Campaign"
 antiash_jexus_desc:0 "'Whoever controls central Ga Xal, controlls the Gomic' - atleast that's what one of our chieftains said. The Moshirian maybe aren't the best generals, but they will make good soldiers to fuel the Antiash war machine."
 antiash_pyarxu_title:0 "The Shores of Pyarxu"
 antiash_pyarxu_desc:0 "Taking Pyarxu completes the northern encirclement of Xon. This is a coastal area and while the Antiash never were good sailors we might be able to recruit some locals to our cause."
 antiash_army_title:0 "A Great Army"
 antiash_army_desc:0 "Without a mighty army we will surely be pushed around and eventually conquered."
 antiash_into_title:0 "Into Ga Xal"
 antiash_into_desc:0 "On land, Ga Xal is cut off from the outside world. Our invasions have created a perfect situation to strike and begin the march on Xon."
 antiash_xon_title:0 "Conquer Xon"
 antiash_xon_desc:0 "Back when the Antiash lived solely in the Great Desert no one would have thought that one day glorious Xon will fall to our regiments. Yet here we are, ready to join the list of this mighty city's owners, and loot the various libraries of the city!"
 antiash_prepare_title:0 "Prepare the Attack"
 antiash_prepare_desc:0 "We have made the Great Sanctuary Lake a new home, but it is not completely ours. The Totinos tribe prevents us from colonising the much drier, but still valuable eastern coast. They must be chased out."
 antiash_settle_title:0 "Settle the East Bank"
 antiash_settle_desc:0 "With the Totinos gone the the east bank is open for settlement, and the lake can truly be called ours."
 antiash_population_title:0 "Large Population"
 antiash_population_desc:0 "A large population will allow us to settle far away lands and finally rival the northerners."
 antiash_delkum_title:0 "Cross the Delkum Desert"
 antiash_delkum_desc:0 "Our way through the wasteland should be made easier by the reclamation of a former Delkian settlement abandoned after the Oppian war. They considered it not worth sustaining, but we are desert people and know better!"
 antiash_south_delkia_title:0 "A Foothold in Delkia"
 antiash_south_delkia_desc:0 "To secure an entrace to eastern Ga Xal, we must begin carving out a territory in the arid crags of southern Delkia."
 antiash_delkian_title:0 "Take the Delkian Bay"
 antiash_delkian_desc:0 "Conquering what remains of the Delkians and the weak western Hoxoi should make us a dominant power in the region. No one will question our mighty army!"
 antiash_ximal_title:0 "Siege Ximal"
 antiash_ximal_desc:0 "Only the capture of Marn is needed to connect our possesions with Maky. The ancient city of Ximal towers over this hard to traverse area and it's defences will come in useful once an Antiash garnison moves in."
 antiash_calla_title:0 "Drought in Vinia"
 antiash_calla_desc:0 "It is ironic that a region famous for worshipping water will fall under the rule of desert people? Seizing this region will enable us to use the other important element of Ga Xalian culture - high quality mercenaries, who should have no problem with helping us reach our goals."
 antiash_relxal_title:0 "Reach Relxal"
 antiash_relxal_desc:0 "Annexing Relxal will complete the southern part of Xon's encirclement."
 antiash_buildings_title:0 "Build Buildings"
 antiash_buildings_desc:0 "The Great Sancturay Lake shall be more developed, everyone will thank us."
 antiash_invade_title:0 "Invade the East Oppians"
 antiash_invade_desc:0 "With this strip of desert secured, we are ready to launch an invasion of the coast from all directions."
 antiash_kinvirel_title:0 "Own Kinvirel"
 antiash_kinvirel_desc:0 "We've made it so far it would be a shame to not go a little further and conquer Kinvirel, a rich trading city and the first democracy in Jasua. Perhaps their knowledge will help us better run the country."
 antiash_approach_title:0 "Approach Hoxoi"
 antiash_approach_desc:0 "We should set up a few outposts near the coast, to make future conquests easier."
 antiash_further_title:0 "Further East"
 antiash_further_desc:0 "Why stop when new lands await the Antiash?"
 antiash_yabonia_title:0 "Yabonian Drylands"
 antiash_yabonia_desc:0 "Southern Yabonia reminds us of our dear homeland. If we were to gain a significant position in this region many soldiers would settle down and develop this place."
 antiash_raid_title:0 "Raid Five Capitals"
 antiash_raid_desc:0 "We should raid five great capitals and bring the riches to the Lake. Let the Antiash raiders be known across the whole Famana!"
 antiash_invite_title:0 "Invite Metallurgists"
 antiash_invite_desc:0 "If we want to become a great nation we cannot be behind the rest of the world - withouth metallurgy. Any country foolish enough to befriend us will surely send their experts to our homeland."
 antiash_reform_title:0 "Reform Bosisi"
 antiash_reform_desc:0 "The Bosisi faith is a very primitive and unorganized one. Every province worships it's own, slightly altered version, human sacrifices often happen without any good reasoning and there is no religious hierarchy. This makes governing our country much more difficult than it could be. It is the responsibility of the king to take control and reform our religion according to the northern model."
 antiash_culture_title:0 "Develop Antiash Culture"
 antiash_culture_desc:0 "We need to prove that the Antiash aren't just bloodthirsty raiders from some backwater region. Our capital will become a shining beacon, inhabited by architects, mathematicians and the like."
 antiash_cotton_title:0 "Grow the Cotton Industry"
 antiash_cotton_desc:0 "Cotton production is a niche that we could easily occupy. Manthwaris are already requesting to be assisted in the development of their facilities, which are bound to be more profitable than mere cattle."
 antiash_promote_title:0 "Advertise Antiash Cotton"
 antiash_promote_desc:0 "As far as we are aware, the Great Sanctuary Lake is the only region producing large amounts of cotton. If we popularised this product among the Gomic elite we would earn lots of money."
 antiash_kashroon_title:0 "Rebuild Kashroon"
 antiash_kashroon_desc:0 "The ancient Kashroonian temple has fallen, but it can be rebuilt and repurposed for the Bosisi faith, which isn't so different from the Mak or Kashroonic beliefs. We will proclaim to the world that the ancient Gomic religion isn't dead!"
 antiash_ganush_title:0 "Appease the Ganush"
 antiash_ganush_desc:0 "The Ganushan are fiery and warlike people. To gain their respect and trust we need to prove that we can wage war for battles and honor itself."
 antiash_kurkari_title:0 "Appease the Kurkari"
 antiash_kurkari_desc:0 "Kurkaris are divided into many powerful factions. We should ally themselves with some and persecute the undesirables. They will have no choice but to take up arms and their fate will be sealed."
 antiash_manthwar_title:0 "Appease the Manthwari"
 antiash_manthwar_desc:0 "The Manthwari have become linked to the merchant class of our country so much that in some areas being a trader and being a Manthwari is interchangeable. Therefore, if to please them we need to please the burghers."
 antiash_ashdamir_title:0 "Appease the Ashdamiri"
 antiash_ashdamir_desc:0 "The Ashdamiri people have been complaining that they got the smallest and least habitable piece of land after the migration. To fix this problem leaders of their major clans found a beautiful area in Delkia. They give us a deal - if we prepare it for their settlement they will swear loyalty."
 antiash_happy_tribes_title:0 "The Great Meeting"
 antiash_happy_tribes_desc:0 "Now that all four tribes are content and ready to cooperate, we can hold a great meeting and reform to realm."
 
 ANTIASH_RAID_5_CAPITALS:0 "We have occupied five different capitals"
 ANTIASH_ALLIES_MET:0 "Any allied country:\nHas embraced §YMetallurgy§!"

 af_anti_fashran_coalition_desc:0 "A terrifying menace is threatening to destroy the world as we know it. The Fashran hordes, if allowed to reign free in Jasua, will destroy our nation, loot our cities and kill our people. We must do everything we can to prevent this, starting with the construction of an alliance network to protect our country. Together we stand, divided we fall."

 af_rout_the_horde_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply defeat the Fashrans. We must deal a blow so devastating that their armies will be forced on the run! Only when the forces of Fashros have lost all motivation to fight can we truly drive them out of Jasua and achieve ultimate victory."

 lyp_unite_erenna_title:0 "Unite Erenna"
