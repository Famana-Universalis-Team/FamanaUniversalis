 Lukscha_2_desc:0 "Lukscham, while generally tolerant, was very brutal when it came to war. Massacres were common, and surrender was almost never accepted."
 Lukscha_3_desc:0 "The Clan Mothers who ruled Lukscham pre-unification were averse to using diplomacy. It was customary to settle disputes on the battlefield, and this attitude continues into the days of the empire."

This produces skilled and well-mannered leaders, who have undisputed legitimacy in the eyes of the Soy people."
 soy_2_desc:0 "Soy's diplomats are well-known throughout the entire world for their unique and well-polished skills; they are the best in making meaningful insults, able to defeat all opponents in any debate. Their reputation has gained them the very prestigious title of 'Soyjack'."
 soy_3_desc:0 "The name of the nation of Soy comes from the very special local good produced here; Soy. In the hot desert climate, home of the Soy, nothing can grow. Nothing, expect for Soy that is. Because of it's unique properties, The Soy are masters at growing Soy and Soy Soy is regarded as the best in the world. This also gives the Soy a very strong sense of culture and identity; something that is only in Soy and of the Soy."
 soy_4_desc:0 "Mayu'Tasi is the Soy-God of the Soy; he came upon the world; and upon coming on it he created it all. Soon after; he created the earth; and for his special people; the Soy people, he created a vast desert. The Soy were Mayu'Tasi's strongest children, so they lived in the harshest lands. He blessed the Soy with Soy so that they have something to eat, and now he watched his children, waiting for them to eventually dominate the planet. Such is the origin story of the Soy; they know that the Soy are Mayu'Tasi's chosen and are ready for their destiny which propels them foward into the future, against their enemies."
 soy_5_desc:0 "Soy has a special property that, if grinded down to a powder and then cooked, can be served as an adrenaline-inducing drug. The Soy Powder is one of the strongest drugs on earth, and the Soy are very-well known for it. It's commonly used in Soy during battle, which greatly enhances the speed of the soldiers, aswell as their fierceness."
 soy_6_desc:0 "While the Soy Powder is used mainly for battle, many intellectuals in Soy have recently started to use it while debating or writing poetry. Because of it, the intellectual class of Soy is very specific and special. Political, Soy lines of thought are regarded as the most erotic and extreme; yet very much intriguing (though in many cases they do advocate for the state to focus on rather weird things; such as the creation of a naval academy and an admiral board), meanwhile Soy poetry is the most special there is; many Soy classics are highly regarded throughout the entire world for their speciality. This makes Soy a cultural hivemind. Due to the special diet of the Soy people, and the frequency in which they cry, Soy tears are very special. So special in fact, that once collected and dried up, they serve as excellent blue dye (hence the blue colour of the Soy flag). This dye is among the best in the world; it is very promiment in local art and culture aswell. Soy Dye gives the Soy people a great product to sell. After selling it, Soy merchants will commonly seethe about how it was stolen or how they sold it incorrectly, aftewards attacking the person whom they sold the dye to. Nonetheless, it is such a great product that they will still go back for more.."
